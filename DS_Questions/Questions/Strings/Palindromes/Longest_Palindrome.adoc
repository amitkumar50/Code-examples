== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/description/[409. Longest Palindrome]
Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest 
palindrome
 that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome.
```c
Example 1:
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

Example 2:
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
```

== Approach. Count Characters. O(n)
=== Logic
```c
s = "abccccdd"
a=1
b=1
c=3
d=2
```
* Count number of characters using hash table
* if character count == even      //Taken completely into palindrome
* if character count == odd       //We have not found any character with count=1 before
                                    Take odd count, and we will not take any element count=1 coming next

=== Complexity
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n)

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestPalindrome(string s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> umCount;
        int count = 0;
        bool one = false;
        for (auto&ch:s)
            umCount[ch]++;
        if (umCount.size() == 1) {
            auto it = umCount.find(s[0]);
            return it->second;
        }
        for (auto [k, v]: umCount) {
            if (v%2 == 0) {   //Even counted element, take all
                count += v;
            } else if (v>2 && v%2==1) { //odd elements, greater than 2
                if (!one) {         // if middle element of palindrome is not yet choosen
                    count += v;
                    one = true;
                }else
                    count += v-1;
            }
            else if (v==1 && one==false) {  //if middle element of palindrome not yet choosen
                one = true;
                count += 1;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
==== Rust
```rs
use std::collections::HashMap;
impl Solution {
    pub fn longest_palindrome(s: String) -> i32 {
        let mut hm:HashMap<char, i32> = HashMap::new();
        let mut one:bool = false;
        let mut count = 0;
        // Count the occurrences of each character
        for c in s.chars() {
            *hm.entry(c).or_insert(0) += 1;
        }
        if hm.len() == 1 {
            
        }
        // Calculate the length of the longest palindrome
        for &v in hm.values() {
            if v % 2 == 0 {
                count += v;
            } else {
                count += v - 1;
                one = true;
            }
        }
        // Add one if there was at least one odd count
        if one {
            count += 1;
        }

        count
    }
}
```
