- _Sprint starts with:_ a planning meeting, where the tasks for the sprint are identified and an estimated commitment for the sprint goal is made.

## Agile
- Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach(framework) for software delivery that builds software incrementally, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.
- It works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called [user stories](#us), prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short two week cycles called **Agile iterations**.
- Agile refers to any process that aligns with the concepts of the Agile Manifesto.
