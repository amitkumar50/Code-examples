## Types of Interrupts
- **1. Hardware Interrupt:** 
  - Generated by H/W. Eg pressing a key on keyboard, Mouse movement, timers, disk drives, signals from network, loss of electrical power.
  - Types of H/W Interrupts:            a. Maskable:            b. Non-Maskable:
- **2. Software Interrupt:** Interrupt that originates in software(process in user mode).When a process makes a system call(Eg: opening socket()), it causes the CPU to switch temporarily into kernel mode, which has administrative privileges to do any task. When the kernel has satisfied the process's request, it restores the process to user mode. How to make S/W Interrupt?
```asm
        mov rax,4    ;Store system-call number in rax register
        mov rbx,arg1    ;Store arguments of system-call in rbx,rcx,rdx,rsi,rdp registers
        mov rcx,arg2
        int 0x80        ;Call S/W Interrupt. Just call int function with Interrupt number.    //As int is called Control Reaches IVT, Interrupt Vector table
```
