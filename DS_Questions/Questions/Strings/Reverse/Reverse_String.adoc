Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
```c
Example 1:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

== C++11
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        for (auto it=s.begin(),itr = s.end() - 1;  //Multiple Initializations
             it < itr;                             //Condition Check
             ++it, --itr                           //Multiple inc,dec
            )
            swap(*it, *itr);
    }
};
```
