== Indexing
Technique to search data in database faster. This improve search/insert/modify operations time. 

=== Types of Indexing
==== 1. Forward Indexing
Index is a hash-table which stores key and offset in the file.
```c
key     Value
123456:{name: London, attractions: [Big Ben, London Eye]}\n
42:{name: San Francisco, attractions: [Golden Gate, Bridge]}\n
```
Now to access any `<key, value>` in Database we search key in Indexing Hash map and then go the offset in file.

==== 2. Reverse/Inverted/Secondary Indexing
Mapping of words to document or set of documents. Indexing is slow as it first checks that word is present or not. Searching is very fast.

=== Primary vs Clustered vs Secondary Indexing
- *a. Primary indexing:* Anchor attribute we use for searching is the primary key(unique value for entry in table.)
- *b. Clustered indexing:* Main Record file is sorted. Primary or non primary key can be used for searching. 
- *c. secondary indexing:* Main record file is not sorted. We have to keep every-entry's primary key into index File.
