Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

```c
Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
```
<img 
```c
Example 2:
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
```

== Approach-1. Store nodes in vector
=== Logic
* Read listnode pointers into vector.
* Find position of node to be deleted from begginning.
```c
  position_from_begg_of_node_to_be_deleted = vec.size() - n

n = 2
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
              /\
```
* Make next of 3 to next of 5.

=== Complexity
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n)

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        vector<ListNode*> positions;
        ListNode* p = head;
        while (p) {
           positions.push_back(p);
           p = p->next;
        }
        int totalNodes = positions.size();

        // Handle the case when the node to be deleted is the head of the list
        if (n == totalNodes) {
            ListNode* newHead = head->next;
            delete head;
            return newHead;
        }
        // For other nodes
        int nth = totalNodes - n;
        int toBeDeleted = nth + 1;
        
        // Update the next pointer of the previous node
        if (toBeDeleted > 1) {
            positions[toBeDeleted - 2]->next = positions[toBeDeleted - 1]->next;
        } else {
            // If toBeDeleted is the first node, update head
            head = positions[toBeDeleted - 1]->next;
        }
        
        // Delete the node
        delete positions[toBeDeleted - 1];
        
        return head;
    }
};
```
