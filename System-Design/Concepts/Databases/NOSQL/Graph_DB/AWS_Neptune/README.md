## Neptune
- **What?** Used for applications that work with highly connected datasets. Stores billions of relationships and queries the graph with milliseconds latency.
- **Use cases?** Used where you need to create relationships between data and quickly query these relationships.    
- **Examples**
  - *1. social networking* Neptune enables highly interactive graph queries with high throughput to bring social features into your applications.
  - *2. Recommendation engines* Neptune allows you to store relationships between information such as customer interests, friends, and purchase history in a graph. Hence Neptune can be used to make product recommendations 
  - *3. fraud detection* Neptune can use relationships to process financial and purchase transactions in near real time to easily detect fraud patterns. Eg: multiple people sharing the same IP address but residing in different physical addresses.
  - *4. Knowledge Graphs*
    - *What is KG* allows to store information in a graphs and use graph queries to enable users to navigate highly connected datasets.
    - *For example*  if a user is interested in The Mona Lisa, you can also help them discover other works of art by Leonardo da Vinci 
  - *5. Life Sciences* 1. Use Neptune to store models of disease and gene interactions. 2. model chemical compounds as a graph and query for patterns in molecular structures
  - *6. Network / IT Operations* Neptune can store a graph of network and use graph queries to answer questions like how many hosts are running a specific application.
    - Neptune can find hosts or devices that may be compromised. For example, if you detect a malicious file on a host, Neptune can help you to find the connections between the hosts that spread the malicious file, and enable you to trace it to the original host that downloaded it
