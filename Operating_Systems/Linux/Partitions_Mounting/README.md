**Disk Partition**

## Disk Partition
Dividing hard drive into multiple logical storage units called partitions. Disk is partitioned at time of OS installation or later whenever we need to extend/create a partition(using fdisk)
- **Why?**
  - Limit available space to applications or users. 
  - Create a separate area for memory swapping.  
  - Achieve higher data security in case of disaster. By dividing the hard disk in partitions, data can be grouped and separated. In case of accident, only the data in the partition that got the hit will be damaged, while the data on the other partitions will most likely survive
