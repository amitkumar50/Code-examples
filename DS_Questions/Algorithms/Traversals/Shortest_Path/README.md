## Shortest Path Algos
- **1. Single Source** Only compute the shortest path from a single source. Works on both directed and non-directed graphs until weight on edge is non-negative.Examples:
  - Dijkstra
  - Bellman-ford
- **2. Multi source** computes the shortest distances between every pair of vertices in graph. Example:
  - Floyd-Warshall
