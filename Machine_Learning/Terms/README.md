### Overfitting
- Means that the model performs well on the training data, but it does not generalize well(ie produces good results on real world/unseen data), because there is too of much uneccessary data(noise) in traning data.
- **Regularization:** Constraining a model to make it simpler and reduce the risk of overfitting.

### Bias/Sampling Bias
- We should use a training data set that is representative of the cases we want model to predict.
- if the sample is too small, you will have sampling noise (i.e., nonrepresentative data as a result of chance), but even very large samples can be nonrepresentative if the sampling method is flawed. This is called sampling bias.

## Tensorflow
- This is ML Open source library(EXPOSING APIs) for numerical computation and large-scale ML supports CPUs & GPUs. 
- Python Front-end APIs & backend written in c++ for high performance.

<a name=t></a>
### Tensor
- Multi-dimensional numpy arrays used to store numbers during computation.
- String tensors donâ€™t exist in Numpy (or in most other libraries), because tensors are preallocated contiguous memory segments, and strings, being variable length.

### Underfitting
- Does not produces good results on traning data.

### Variance
- Variance is the tendency to learn random things unrelated to the real signal
