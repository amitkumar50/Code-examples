### Decentralized
- Control is distributed to many authorities instead of one central authority
- **Adv:**
  - No central authority(Availabilty)
  - reduced costs, competition(hence better technology)
- **Disadv:**
  - Storage of pvt keys data on seperate nodes(what if node is malicious, Security)?
  - Nodes talk to each other(without central authority), if riot happens and we donot want nodes to talk to each other(Security).
  - Node storing data suddenly goes out of network(Availabilty)

### Ways to achieve decentralization
#### Disintermediation (No intermediary)
- Suppose you want to send money to your friend in US.
  - _Method-1:_ Go to bank, bank does transfer, confirms it and takes charges.
  - _Method-2:_ Directly send money(without bank) using blockchain technology. Get address of your friend on the blockchain and send money.
#### Through competition
Many banks/authorities compete and provide best rates for sending money. This is not complete decentralization.

#### Replication vs Decentralization
||Replication|Decentralized|
|---|---|---|
|What|Ensures mutliple copies of data are created on masters or slaves|Same|
|Availabilty|Client talks to master or slave to get data|Client can talk to any node(many different leaders) and will get data, Control is decentralized|
|Examples|MongoDB|Cassandra|
