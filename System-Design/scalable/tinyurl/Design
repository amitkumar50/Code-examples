Step 1: Requirements clarifications
a. Functional:
    a1. Given a URL, our service should generate a shorter and unique alias of it
    a2. When users access short link, our service should redirect them to the original link.
    a3. Users should be able to pick a custom short link for their URL.
    a4. Links should expire after default time span.
b. Non-Function:
    b1. Highly available. 
    b2. Minimum latency
c. Extended requirements:
    c1. Analytics; e.g., how many times a redirection happened?
    
    
Step 2: Back-of-the-envelope estimation   
This is read heavy application. Consider 100:1 Read/Write requests.
a. 10k new URL shortning requests/sec. 10k*60*60*30=1 billion requests/month
b. 60M bytes/sec write
