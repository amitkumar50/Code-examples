### Strings Question
1. Given a string of digits, keep summing the digits and convert them to Hexadecimal. Repeat the same process till minimal 
hexadecimal Value is attained. (Validation of strings had to be done as well). Input 8981 Output B. Eg. 8981 -> Sum=26 ->Hexa 
	   Value 1A->Sum=1+10=11->Hexa Value B (Answer)

2. (Given a String with one type of brackets, validate if it is balanced or not)[https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/]

3. Given a string with parentheses of three types with precedence, validate the balance status of the string.
A higher precedence parentheses can enclose a lower precedence parentheses but not vice and versa.
	
4. Longest Valid Parentheses with precedence order given.

5. [Minimum characters to remove to make a string a balanced parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-remove-to-make-valid-parentheses/)	

### MATRIX Questions
1. (Word Search)[https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/]

### INFINITE-DATA-COMING:
1. Median of infinite stream of numbers. Follow up : Median of two sorted sets in O(log(n))

### DESIGN:
1. Design a voting system with about 100M users who will use it in a space of 1 day distributed randomly 
across the world.(Assume a platform where NRI and Indian residents are allowed voting). Make all necassary 
assumptions and keep in mind the scale of the system.

2. Vehicular Live tracking and notifications based on certain events(Overspeeding,Breakdown etc).
