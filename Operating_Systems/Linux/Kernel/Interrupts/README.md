## Interrupt
- **What?** Interrupt is event generated by hardware(I/O Device) which is sent to CPU by Interrupt Controller. CPU is asked to perform some high priority task wrt what its doing. Information from interrupt(eg: key pressed) is converted to character and stored in buffer to be later used by ISR.

- [High Number of Interrupts](High_No_of_Interrupts.md)
- **Interrupt Numbers?** 256 types of Interrupts(0-255). Examples: 0: Pointer Divide Error    1: Pointer single Step    2: Pointer Non-maskable    3: Pointer I-Byte NIT Instruction    4: Pointer Overflow    5-31: Reserved for future use
- All reported Interrupts are shown in [/proc/interrupts and /proc/stat](Interrupts_Information.md).
