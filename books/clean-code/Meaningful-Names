THESE RULES SHOULD BE FOLLOWED

1. USE INTENTION REVEALING NAMES(function, variable, class)
 - Take care with your names and change them when you find better ones.
 - If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent
 Bad Practice:
  int d; // elapsed time in days
 Good Name:
  int elapsedTimeInDays //specifies what is being measured and the unit of that measurement
  int daysSinceCreation
  
  
2. AVOID DISINFORMATION
 - hp , aix , and sco are poor variable names.
 - referring to a grouping of accounts as an accountList is wrong unless itâ€™s actually a List. just plain accounts would be better
 
 
3. MAKE MEANINGFUL DISTINCTIONS
How are the programmers in this project supposed to know which of these functions to call?
getActiveAccount();
getActiveAccounts();
getActiveAccountInfo();


4. USE PRONUNCABLE WORDS
This matters because programming is a social activity.
class DtaRcrd102 {
  private Date genymdhms;
  private Date modymdhms;
  private final String pszqint = "102";
/* ... */
};
to
class Customer {
  private Date generationTimestamp;
  private Date modificationTimestamp;;
  private final String recordId = "102";
/*... */
};


5. CLASS NAMES
- Should have noun names like Customer , WikiPage ,Account , and AddressParser .
- A class name should not be a verb.


6. METHOD NAMES
- should have verb or verb phrase names like postPayment , deletePage , or save .


7. DONT USE CLEVER/CUTE NAMES
- In place of HolyHandGrenade() DeleteItems() might be a better name.
