Big-IP? 
-Originally 
	- BIG-IP was Load-Balancer. Because it had lot of IP-Addresses behind, it
	  looked its a bigger IP address.
-Today:
  - BIG-IP is family of software & hardware solutions providing:
    a. intelligent traffic management
    b. high availalabilty of applications
    c. Access control
    d. security
    e. optimization
    
	
BIG-IP Software?
 - BIG-IP(v13) is designed to run on TMOS(Traffic management operating system)
BIG-IP Hardware?
 - 11000 series
 - i series
 - Herculan series(for security)
 
 
BIG-IP series?
1. LTM(Local traffic manager): 
	- Create virtual server, apply acl, can do inspect encrypt decrypt. This deals with local data center traffic.
2. DNS/GTM(global traffic manager): Handles global traffic+DNS.
  - Can work with LTM. 
  - Can be authoritative resolver for DNS. 
  - Can do DNSec. 
  - This can check IP address of client and can direct to appropriate data center.
3. APM(Access policy manager): Provides access control 
  - Identity & federation management.
  - Single sign on
  - SAML token, oauth
  - Can inspect with device
  - Portal access to VMWares, AD machines etc
  - Can provide VPN tunnel 
4. SWG(Secure Web gateway): This is kind of forward proxy
  - Manages outbound requests from office to outside.
  - Eg: blocking sites to which you dont want people to browse
5. ASM(Application security manager): L7 web application firewall
  - This protects application from attacks. 
	Ex: Sequql injection, forcefull browsing
6. AFM(Advanced firewall manager):
  - Can work with ASM.
  - Handles L3,L4 network attacks. Eg: Volumetric DDos attacks
7. AAM(Application Acceralation Manager):
  - Does optimizations using algorithms
  - You can manager bandwidth appropriately. 
  - Eg: loosy network, high latency network, database replication
8. WAF(Web application firewalls): 
   Prevents application from Attacks:
    - Malicious bot protection: Automation is used by attackers.
    - Application-layer encryption
    - API inspection
    - Behavior analytics to help defend against application attacks
    - Preventing Identity attacks
  
  
BIGIQ: Management solution for managing all BIG-IPs

Silverline: cloud based service protect against DDos attack

F5aaS:F5 as a service

VE(Virtual Ediiton): These are BIGIP softwares designed to run in virtualized enviornment.
