## Addressing modes
- **1. [Unicast(same as IPv4)](/Networking/IP_Address_Types)**
- **2. [Multicast(same as IPv4)](/Networking/IP_Address_Types)**
- **3. Anycast(new to IPv6):**
  - Same as Broadcast, IPv6 Unicast address assignment happens. All interested receivers registers on Unicast Address. 
  - Router/Switch Delivers the packet to nearest(in terms of routing cost) unicast receiver.
