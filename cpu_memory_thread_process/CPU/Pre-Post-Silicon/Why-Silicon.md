## Silicon(Si)
- All devices supercomputers, smart phones, air microwave ovens are made of silicon chip.

## A. Why Semiconductors are used in making Electronic devices?
- We want devices to be switched between on/off at *ROOM TEMPRATURE*. 
  - Metal conducts electrons hence hard to turn them off.
  - insulators do not conduct electrons, so turning them on is difficult. 
  - Semiconductors are best choice.
- Properties of Semiconductor can be altered sing **doping**(mixing impurities into element to modify its electrical properties), Silicon is doped and it starts amplfiying electrical signals and hence becomes ideal for making transistors.

### A1. Why Si among other semiconductors
- Silicon is abundant on earth's crust(8th most abundant element on earth) hence cheap.
- Si has lower carrier mobilities (ie electrons don't move as fast per second) wrt to other semiconductors(germanium, gallium arsenide).
- Billions of dollars and huge time spent over the several decades perfecting the process of making chips using Si. Even if another material might be better than silicon, a huge amount of time (many years!) and money (billions of dollars!) would be required to be invested again.
- Wrt germanium Si is good at high temperatures because electron bonds are stronger in silicon than in germanium. Germanium has weaker bonds to its electrons and at high temperatures these bonds may be broken and lead to worse performance.
- Easy to add layer of insulator over silicon and easy to create MOSFET/transistor devices.
