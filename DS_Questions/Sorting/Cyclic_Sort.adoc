== Cyclic Sort
* works for arrays containing values within a specific range
* It's an in-place, unstable algorithm that aims to sort the elements by arranging them in their correct positions, 1 at a time through a series of swaps.
* The basic idea is to iterate through the array and place each element in its intended position until the entire array is sorted.
* Example:
```cpp
arr = [3,4,1,5,2]

```
