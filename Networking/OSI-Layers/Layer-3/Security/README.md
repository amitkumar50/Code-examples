## Information Security
Consitutues of 4 parts

<a name=sec></a>
## 1. Secrecy / Confidentiality / Encryption / Cryptography
Conversion of Data/Plain-text into unreadable/cipher text.

### Cipher Algorithms
1. Substitution Cipher: Each letter or group of letters is replaced by another letter or group of letters. Eg: Caesar ciphers(b becomes E, c becomes F)
2. Block Ciphers(Mostly used): Encrypt block of characters        
3. Stream Ciphers(Obsolete): Encrypt Single character at a time


### How Encryption is performed at H/W Level
ONLY POSITION OF BITS ARE CHANGED

<a name=pb></a>
#### A. Permutation / P-box / Transposition Box
Perform internal transposition(change place) and do it at practically the speed of light since no computation is involved, just signal propagation. Internal wiring is not known to world.

#### B. Substitution / S-box
This can have multiple stages of P-box inside providing more complex method bit position shifting. 
- Product Cipher
  - Actual Cipher can use multiple P,S box stages inside to provide better cryptography. With large number of stages output can be a complicated function of the input. 
  - Actual implementations have minimum of 10 stages.
  - There are more P-boxes at start and end, called Rounds.

  - _B._ Authentication: whom you are talking to before revealing sensitive information
  - [_C._ Nonrepudiation](/Integrity/Digital_Signature): Sender cannot deny that he has not sent the message.
  - [_D._ Integrity:](Integrity) message you received was really the one sent and not something that a malicious adversary Encryption + Integrity
