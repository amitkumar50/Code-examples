=== System Design Architectural Patterns
|===
| Pattern Name | Detials | Type | Advantages

|1.Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
a|
* User -command-> Thread-1(Command center) -write-> DB
* DB -read-> Thread-2(Read service)
| Synchronous Event Driven 
| less complex

|2. Two-Phase Commit (2PC) 
a|
* (Prepare Phase). Coordinator tells service to prepare data
* (Commit Phase). Coordinator tells service to send data
** Ech service is unlocked 1 byt 1 to send data
| Synchronous Event Driven
| Consistent, Resistant to error

|3. Saga (eg: AWS)
a|
* services communicate using Bus/Queue
| Asynchronous Event Driven
| Longer transactions can be handled

|4. Replicated Load-Balanced Services (RLBS)
a|
* Duplicate services sit behind load balancer
| 
| Consistent performance, Quick recoverly

|5. Sharded Services
a|
* Multiple services, each completing specific task
| Asynchronous
| Simple to debug
