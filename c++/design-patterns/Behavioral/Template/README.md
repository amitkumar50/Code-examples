### Definition
  - This deﬁnes the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. 
  - Template Method lets subclasses to redeﬁne certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm’s structure.

### What is template?
  - Method present in base class, which defines algorithms of steps(functions called in specific order).
  - Some algorithms are kept intact(should not be overriden), while others allowed to be overridden.
