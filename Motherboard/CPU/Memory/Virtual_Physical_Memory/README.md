### Virtual Memory = Hard Disk / Physical Memory = RAM
- **Why VM?**
  - Now-a-days processes are RAM hungry. Every Program(eg: adobe photoshop, microsoft teams) need more RAM. 
  - if 10 such processes want to run simultaneously then 10GB RAM is needed which is not available. VM is illusion to program that it has complete access to RAM.
