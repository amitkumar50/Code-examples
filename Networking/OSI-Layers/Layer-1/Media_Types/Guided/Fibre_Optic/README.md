## Fibre Optic
- An optical transmission system has three key components: the light source, the transmission medium, and the detector.
- **How it works?**
  - Information: 
    - 1 Bit: pulse of light.
    - 0 Bit: Absence of light.
  - Trasmittion Medium: ultra-thin fiber of glass
  - Reciever(Detector): Generates an electrical pulse(1) when light falls on it.
  - Sender: Light source
