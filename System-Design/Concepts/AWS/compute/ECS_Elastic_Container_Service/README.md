## ECS(Elastic Container Service)
- **What?** [Container](/System-Design/Concepts/All_About_Containers/Container.md) management service, We can run/stop/manage Docker containers on a cluster.
- **AWS Fargate**
  - This is an easy way to deploy your containers on AWS.
  - Fargate is like EC2 but instead of giving you a virtual machine you get a container.
