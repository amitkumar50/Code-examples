Round-1(Design):
 1. Design a resource manager class that does management of vlan structures.
    a. Allocates 4096 vlan structures.
	    struct vlan{
		int vlanid;
		struct test 
	    };	
    b. givevlanid(): Provide a free(vlan structure address or vlanid) to requester. 
    c. freevlanid(): Frees the vlan structure when requestor asks to release vlanid.
    - Use single threaded approach.
    - Design efficient data structures for above.
