## Objects
- Instance of class. 
- Objects can be real-world Eg: albert Einstein, Samsung Company or Non-real world/conceptual entities (Simulation run, formula for solving equation). 
- In real-world Identical Objects are not possible, but in OOPs they are possible. 
- Everything that has "state and has behavior" can be said to be object.
