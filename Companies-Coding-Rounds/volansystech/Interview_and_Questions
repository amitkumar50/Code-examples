Round-1(hangout):
 a. Implement strrev() using recursion
 b. Find n points(x,y) are collinear or not?
	- Similar to finding non-duplicate permutations of string
 c. const variable?
 d. volatile variable? Can we have and its usecases?
 e. const volatile variable? Can we have and its usecases?
 f. mmap() API?
 g. DMA(Direct memory access) in kernel?
