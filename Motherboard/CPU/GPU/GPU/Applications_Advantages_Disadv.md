## Advantages
  - *1.* GPU has 1000's of cores making them great for small computations done in parallel.
  - *2.* Encryption, Decryption or processing of network traffic.

## Disadvantage
  - *1.* Not good for serial tasks.
  - *2.* Hard to program.

## Applications/Usages //Used in parallel computing
  - Rendering polygons in graphics applications
  - Used in mobile phones, PCs, workstations, game consoles.
  - Create high resolution images, videos.
  - In machine training, deep learning neural networks, GPUs can be 250 times faster than CPUs.
  - Complex mathematical calculations, financial simulations and risk modeling
