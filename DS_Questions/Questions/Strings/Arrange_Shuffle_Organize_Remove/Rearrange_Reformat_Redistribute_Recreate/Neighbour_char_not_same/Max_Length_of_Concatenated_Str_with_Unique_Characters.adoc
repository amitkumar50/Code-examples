== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-a-concatenated-string-with-unique-characters/description/[1239. Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters]
You are given an array of strings arr. A string s is formed by the concatenation of a subsequence of arr that has unique characters.

Return the maximum possible length of s.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
```c
Example 1:
Input: arr = ["un","iq","ue"]
Output: 4
Explanation: All the valid concatenations are:
- ""
- "un"
- "iq"
- "ue"
- "uniq" ("un" + "iq")
- "ique" ("iq" + "ue")
Maximum length is 4.

Example 2:
Input: arr=["aa", "bc"]
Output: 2
Explanation: skip "aa" string since it has repetative characters
```

== Approach-1. Using vector
=== Logic
1. Take a vector in which we will note all valid combinations
2. Create word which need to be placed into vector by combining input word and string.
3. Check does the created word have any repetative characters?
```c
  uniq  //No repetative character
  unue  //Have repetative character "u"
```

=== Complexity
* Time: O(mn)
* Space: O(m)+O(n)

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    //["un","iq","ue"]
    int maxLength(vector<string>& arr) {
    
        // 1. Vector in which we will note all valid combinations
        // {"uniq", "ique"]
        vector<string> output = {""};      //size=1
		
        int maxLen = 0;
        for (string word : arr) {
		
            for (int i = 0; i < output.size(); i++) {
			
              // 2. Create a string by combining out vector
              // and input word
              // temp = "uniq", "unue"
                string temp = output[i] + word;
				
              // 3. Find repetative characters,
              //  a. Insert word into set "unue"=>"une"
              //  b. if input word size != us.size "unue"!="une"
              //		No need to consider, continue
                unordered_set<char> us(temp.begin(), temp.end());
                if (temp.size() != us.size())
                    continue;

                // if combined string is valid, "uniq"
                // insert into output vector and record
                // max len
                output.push_back(temp);
                maxLen = max(maxLen, (int)temp.size());
            }
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
};
```
