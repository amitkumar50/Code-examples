These collectively is called STL:
1. Containers: Data structures for storing data. Types:
	a. Sequence/Ordered:
		- Eg: vectors, deque, list, forward list, array
	b. Associative:
		- Elements are always sorted. Implemented as binary trees.
		- Eg: set, multiset, map, multipmap
	c. Unordered: Hash tables
		- Eg: unordered set, multiset, unordered map, multimap
2. Algorithms: This is logic to work on containers. algorithms works via iterators over containers
3. Iterators: This is interface to iterate through containers.
4. Functors/Function Objects:

Why STLs are recommended?
- Code reuse
- Incresed program speed & quality
- Tested code
- Less buggy
- Standardized
- reduce control flow in code
