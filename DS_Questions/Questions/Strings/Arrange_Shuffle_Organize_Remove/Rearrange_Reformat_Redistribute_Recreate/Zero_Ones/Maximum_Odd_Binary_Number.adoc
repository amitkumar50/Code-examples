== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-odd-binary-number/[2864. Maximum Odd Binary Number]
You are given a binary string s that contains at least one '1'.

You have to rearrange the bits in such a way that the resulting binary number is the maximum odd binary number that can be created from this combination.

Return a string representing the maximum odd binary number that can be created from the given combination.

Note that the resulting string can have leading zeros.

```c
Example 1:
Input: s = "010"
Output: "001"
Explanation: Because there is just one '1', it must be in the last position. So the answer is "001".

Example 2:
Input: s = "0101"
Output: "1001"
Explanation: One of the '1's must be in the last position. The maximum number that can be made with the remaining digits is "100". So the answer is "1001".
```

== Approach. Count 1s and rearrange
=== Logic
* Count total number of 1's in input string
* if only one 1 is present only possible way = "00001"
* if all 1s are there in array = "1111". return input array itself
* more than one, 1's found in input string
** place all 1's at start, then all 0's and
** place only last 1 at end
```c
input =  "1010111"
output = "1111001"
```

=== Complexity
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n)

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string maximumOddBinaryNumber(string s) {
        int total_chars = 0, n = 0;
        string out;

        // Count 1 bits
        int ones_count = 0;
        for (char& i : s) {
            if (i == '1')
                ones_count++;
            total_chars++;
        }
        if (ones_count == total_chars)
            return s;

        // if only one, 1 we have only possible no = 0001
        if (ones_count == 1) {
            while (n++ < total_chars - 1) 
                out += "0";
            out += "1";
            return out;
        }

        int zero_count = total_chars - ones_count;

        // more than one, 1's found in input string
        // place all 1's at start, then all 0's and
        // place only last 1 at end
        while (n++ < ones_count-1)
            out += "1";
        int val = n + zero_count;
        while (n++ < val)
            out += "0";
        out += "1";

        return out;
    }
};
```
