# Voltage Rail
- **What?** 
  - In a PC, different components use different voltage levels, and so a power supply must take the electricity from the wall and split it into 12v, 5v, and 3.3v power. 
  - A rail is simple a wire/path inside the PSU that carries electricity of a certain voltage.
  The 12v rail provides power for GPUs and CPUs, generally the two most power-hungry components.
  
## Types of Voltage Rails 

|Rail Name|Description|
|---|---|
|1. GFX|Voltage in use while GPU is not idle|
|2. SOC|voltage floor for rest of the the SoC(System on chip)|
|3. HBM||
|4. PCIE||
|5. VPP||
|6. SVI||
