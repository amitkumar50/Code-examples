- *1.* For a continuous image f(x, y), how could be Sampling defined?   Ans: Digitizing the coordinate values
- *2.* To convert a continuous image f(x, y) to digital form, we have to sample the function in?  Ans: All
- *3.* For a given image in one-dimension given by function f(x, y), to sample the function we take equally spaced samples, superimposed on the function, along a horizontal line. However, the sample values still span (vertically) a continuous range of gray-level values. So, to convert the given function into a digital function, the gray-level values must be divided into various discrete levels. Ans:True
- *4.* The quality of a digital image is well determined by?  Ans: All
