## Information Security
Consitutues of 4 parts

<a name=sec></a>
## 1. Secrecy / Confidentiality / Encryption / Cryptography
Conversion of Data/Plain-text into unreadable/cipher text.

### Types of Encryption
#### 1. Assymetric /2 key
Public key(encrypt), Private key(decrypt). Data encrypted with Public can only be decrypted using Pvt key. Both are mathematically linked. Public Key are published on website publicly.
```c
                  \/Public-Key                      \/Pvt-Key        
Plain text > | Encryptor | >   Cipher Text  > | Decryptor | > Plain text
```
**Example Alice and Bob communication**
  - *1.* Alice created his own Public(Pub_A),Pvt(Pvt_A) key pairs. Published Public key on his website and kept pvt secret.
  - *2.* Bob also created his own public(Pub_B), Pvt(Pvt_B) key pairs and published on his website.
  - *3.* Alice and bob can communicate using each other's public keys.
```html
  Bob  <--read Alice public key---   http://alice.com
  Alice <--read Bob public key--     http://bob.com

    Bob                                                   Alice
            Pub_A                                             Pvt_A
             \/                                                 \/
  message > |Encrypt| > XXX   ---sent to Alice--->      XXX > Decrypt > message
```
**Algorithms**

**DH(Diffe-Helman)**
DH Keys sizes
```c
Group  | No of Bits |  Combinations  | Strong 
-------|------------|----------------|----------
   1   |   768      | 2<sup>768</sup>|
   2   |   1024     |                |
   5   |   1536     |                | Strongest
```
Algo:
```html
    Host-A                                        Host B 
        ----------Prime=p=13, Integer=q=6------->      //p is prime of min 600 digits
    Random-no=r=3                              Random-no=r=10
    
  Public-Key=qPow(r)modp 
  6pow(3)mod(13) = 8                           6pow(10)mod13 = 4
        -----------Public Key = 8----------------->
        <---------Public Key = 4------------------
        
  Private-Key = (Public Key)pow(Random No) mod(p)             
  4 pow(3)mod(13) = 12                        8pow(10)mod(13) = 12 
```

### Cipher Algorithms
1. Substitution Cipher: Each letter or group of letters is replaced by another letter or group of letters. Eg: Caesar ciphers(b becomes E, c becomes F)
2. Block Ciphers(Mostly used): Encrypt block of characters        
3. Stream Ciphers(Obsolete): Encrypt Single character at a time


### How Encryption is performed at H/W Level
ONLY POSITION OF BITS ARE CHANGED

<a name=pb></a>
#### A. Permutation / P-box / Transposition Box
Perform internal transposition(change place) and do it at practically the speed of light since no computation is involved, just signal propagation. Internal wiring is not known to world.

<a name=sb></a>
#### B. Substitution / S-box
This can have multiple stages of P-box inside providing more complex method bit position shifting. 
- Product Cipher
  - Actual Cipher can use multiple P,S box stages inside to provide better cryptography. With large number of stages output can be a complicated function of the input. 
  - Actual implementations have minimum of 10 stages.
  - There are more P-boxes at start and end, called Rounds.

  - _B._ Authentication: whom you are talking to before revealing sensitive information
  - [_C._ Nonrepudiation](/Integrity/Digital_Signature): Sender cannot deny that he has not sent the message.
  - [_D._ Integrity:](Integrity) message you received was really the one sent and not something that a malicious adversary Encryption + Integrity
