## How Unguided Communication Works
- When electrons move, they create **electromagnetic waves** that can propagate through space (even in a vacuum).
- When an antenna is attached to an electrical circuit, the electromagnetic waves can be broadcast efficiently and received by a receiver some distance away.
  - In vaccum EM waves travel at speed of light = 3 x 10<sup>8</sup>. //The speed of light is the ultimate speed limit. No object or signal can ever move faster than it.
- Amount of information that a signal such as an electromagnetic wave can carry depends on the received power and is proportional to its bandwidth.
