## Hash Table
  - **What** Data structure that associates keys with values and supports constant time lookups ie Search complexity = O(1){Average Case}. O(n){Worst case}
  - [Advantages Disadv of HashTables](Advantages_Disadv_of_HashTables.md)
  - *Hash Function?* Hash function maps a big number or string to a small integer that can be used as index in hash table.
  - *[How Hash Table is implemented Internally](How_HashTable_Implemented_Internally)*
```c
  key -> |Hash Function| -> index of array/table
```
