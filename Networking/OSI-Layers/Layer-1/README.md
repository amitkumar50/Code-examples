## Layer-1 / Physical Layer
- **What?** Defines electrical, timing and other interfaces by which bits are sent as signals over channels.
- **Protocols?** 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, Fibre Optic, Copper Cable, Twisted Pair cable
- **Transmission Technologies?** copper wire and fiber optics), wireless (terrestrial radio), and satellite.
- **How Information can be sent over wire?** By varying some physical property such as voltage or current. No transmission facility can transmit signals without losing some power in the process. Usually, for a wire, the amplitudes are transmitted mostly undiminished from 0 up to some frequency fc(measured in cycles/sec or Hertz (Hz)), with all frequencies above this cutoff frequency attenuated.
