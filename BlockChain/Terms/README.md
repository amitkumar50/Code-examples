### Blockchain
A sequence of blocks validated by the proof-of-work system, each linking to its predecessor all the way to the genesis block.
### Consensus algorithm
Ethereum uses Bitcoinâ€™s consensus model, Nakamoto Consensus, which uses sequential single-signature blocks, weighted in importance by PoW to determine the longest chain and therefore the current state. However, there are plans to move to a PoS weighted voting system, codenamed Casper, in the near future.
