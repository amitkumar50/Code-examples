### Problem
- Find longest common subsequence in 2 strings.
- Example
```c++
Example-1: str1 = "sea",str2 = "eat"
           Answer = "ea" of length 2
           
Example-2: str1 = “AGGTAB”, str2 = “GXTXAYB” 
          Answer = “GTAB” of length 4. 
```

## Approach-1 (Recursive)
- Generate all subsequences of both given sequences and find the longest matching subsequence.
- **How** Match every character with other character. BUT PROBLEM: Many subproblems which are solved again and again eg:"se,e". And in bigger string these repeated recurions will be more.
- **Complexity** 2<sup>n</sup>
```c++
                sea, eat
                /       \
            sea,ea      se,ea
            /           /   \
          se,e        se,e   s,ea
          /           /       \
         s,0        s,0       0,a
```
### Code-1(Recursion)
```c++
int lcs(string& a, string& b, int m, int n){
  if (m == 0 || n == 0)
    return 0;

  if (a[m-1] == b[n-1])
    return 1 + lcs(a, b, m-1, n-1);
  else
    return max(lcs(a, b, m, n-1), lcs(a, b, m-1, n));
}
int main(){
  string a = "sea";  string b = "eat";
  cout<<"Length of LCS is "<< lcs(a, b, a.size(), b.size()) ;     //2
}
```
