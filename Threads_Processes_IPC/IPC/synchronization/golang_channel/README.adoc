== Channels
* Used for communication and synchronization between goroutines

== Characteristics of channels in Go
* Typed
** they can only transmit values of a specific data type

* Buffered or Unbuffered
** Unbuffered channels block the sender until the receiver is ready to receive the value
** Buffered channels allow the sender to proceed without blocking until the buffer is full.

* Concurrency-safe
** channels are inherently thread-safe

== Channel code
```go
package main

import (
"fmt"
    "time"
)

// ch is Recv-only channel.
// Channels of type(chan<-) are recieve only
func producer(ch chan<- int) {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println("Producing", i)
      
        // Send value to channel (will block until someone receives it)
        ch <- i
      
        time.Sleep(time.Second) // Simulate some work
    }
    close(ch) // Close the channel after producing all values
}

func consumer(ch <-chan int) {
    for num := range ch {
        fmt.Println("Consuming", num)
        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) // Simulate some work
    }
}

func main() {
    // Create a channel.
    // make() function is used to create slices, maps, and channels.
    // Create unbuffered channel that can transmit integer values.
    ch := make(chan int)

    // Start producer and consumer goroutines=Threads
    go producer(ch)
    go consumer(ch)

    // Wait for the goroutines to finish
    time.Sleep(10 * time.Second) // Wait for 10 seconds to see the output
}
```
