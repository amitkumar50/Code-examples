## SSD / Solid State Drives
- *What?* Data store as hard disk. Difference from Hard disk:
  - SSD is much faster than Hard Disks, since contains no moving parts
  - SSD is much costlier than Hard disk.
- *How it stores information?* 
  - SSD stores 3 different bits into Charge trap flash memory making 0-15 number.
  - Number of electrons present in charge trap = binary bit stored in cell.
  - if need to store `000`, charge trap cell will be full of electrons, `111` no electrons.
