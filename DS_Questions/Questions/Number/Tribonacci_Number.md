**N-th Tribonacci Number**
- [Approach-1, dynamic Programming](#a1)
  - [Logic](#l)

- The Tribonacci sequence Tn is defined as follows: 
- T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n >= 0.
- Given n, return the value of Tn.
```c
Example 1:
Input: n = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
T_3 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
T_4 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4

Example 2:
Input: n = 25
Output: 1389537
```
