== React
React is a declarative & flexible frontend JS library for building
* frontend large scale, data driven UIs.
* Andriod, ios apps, Desktop applications
* Virtual Reality Application using react VR.

== Terms
=== Component 
React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.

React components are JavaScript functions that return markup:
```js
function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>I'm a button</button>
  );
}
```

```c
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.
```

== React Element
=== Render element to DOM
```js
var ch1 = React.createElement("h1", null, "Chapter-1")                          //1: Create element without properties
var ch2 = React.createElement("h1", {id:"t", 'data-type:"title"}, "Chapter-2")  //2: Create element with properties
//h1=Type of element. Heading element
//id,data-type: These are properties of element
//Chapter-1=element's children

During rendering react will convert this to actual DOM object.
<h1 >Chapter-1" </h1>
<h1 data-reactroot id="t" data-type="title"> Chapter-2 </h1>    //data-reactroot will always appear as an attribute of the root element.

ReactDOM.render(ch1, document.getElementById('react-container'))    //3. Render element to DOM

<body>
 <div id="react-container">
 <h1>Chapter-1</h1>
 </div>
</body>
```

=== pros.children
data-reactroot: This is tree's root
```js
React.createElement(
 "parent",                                  //This is root element
 null,
 React.createElement("li", null, "child1"), //These are 3 children
 React.createElement("li", null, "child2"),
 React.createElement("li", null, "child3"),
)

arr[] = [child1, child2, child3]          //React creates an array of these child elements and sets the value of props.children to that array.
pros.children = arr
```

== Libraries
=== 1. React library
To create views. 

=== 2. ReactDOM library
