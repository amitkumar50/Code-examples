  - **Sorting(Important)** Merge Sort, Quick Sort(Memorize Implementations)
  - sliding Windows
  - Greedy Algorithms
  - **Resource to learn from:** 1. CS 61 A    2. CS 61 B
  - **Practice portal** Leetcode(premium, as per company category)
  - **After Doing every question:** WRITE Down, 1 thing that would I have done/known to make this thing easier. CHANGE it and DONOT Repeat again.

  - DO LOT OF MOCK INTERVIEWS.  
  - **Method(ASK LOT OF QUESTIONS TO YOURSELF)**
    - *1.* Ask few set of questions to yourself. How can i implement this, what's Big-O notation, where is repetative work happening?
    - *2.* Explain solution in plain english to yourself. (Step-by-step bullets)
    - *3.* Pseudo code
    - *4.* Functions
    - *5.* implement
  - **Make your self Smart**

Ans: 
  Approach-1: 64 iterations. Asked to optimize
  Approach-2: Hamming weight. Asked to optmize more
  Approach-3: Lookup table, cannot tell.
```
Round-2
```c
