## REST / (Representation State Transfer) APIs
- **What?** 
  - When web-client calls Restful APIs then Web-Server will transfer data representing state of the requested resource. Representation can be in [JSON](/Languages/ScriptingLanguages/JavaScript) or HTML or [XML](/Languages/Markup_Language) format.
  - REST are standards which computers/nodes must comply with in order to communicate with each other.
