|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|1.Voltage| Electric potential difference, electric pressure or electric tension is the difference in electric potential between two points.|
|2.Voltage Regulator| Component which takes varied voltage and outputs regulated/cutted voltage `-Varying Voltage->|Voltage Regulator|-Stable Voltage->`|
|3. SVI(Serial VID Interface) Controller/Regulator| Allows dynamic adjustment of the Core and Northbridge output voltages independently and in combination from 0.500V to 1.55V|
|4. Voltage Rail|<ul><li>In a PC, different components use different voltage levels, and so a power supply must take the electricity from the wall and split it into 12v, 5v, and 3.3v power. A rail is simple a wire/path inside the PSU that carries electricity of a certain voltage. The 12v rail provides power for GPUs and CPUs, generally the two most power-hungry components.</li></ul><ul><li>Types: *1. GFX:* Voltage in use while GPU is not idle</li></ul><ul><li>*2. SOC:* voltage floor for rest of the the SoC(System on chip).</li></ul><ul><li>*3. HBM:*,  *4. PCIE:*,  *5. VPP:*,  *6. SVI:*  </li></ul>
