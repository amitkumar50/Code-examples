## 1. Supervised Learning
- The training data feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called labels.
- Supervised learning algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees & Random Forests, Neural networks

### Types of Supervised learning
<a name=c></a>
**1. Classification (give yes/no)**
- _a. Spam Filterning:_ Algo is trained with many example emails along with their class (spam or ham), and it must learn how to classify new emails. Each email has a label.

<a name=r></a>
**2. Regression: (give % or numeric value)**
- _Predictors(Predict something):_
  - Predict whether based on inputs.
  - Predict price of car provided with some inputs((mileage, age, brand, etc.)

<a name=lr></a>
**3. Logistic Regression (yes/no with %)**
- Mix of classfication & Regression.
- Example: 20% of chances being a spam.

<a name=ul></a>
## 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Dataset does not have labels. ML model tries to learn without teacher.
### Types of Unsupervised learning
<a name=cl></a>
**2a. Clustering:**
- 
- Examples: (k-Means, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), Expectation Maximization)
  - _2. Visualization and dimensionality reduction:_ Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA, Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
  - _3. Association rule learning:_ Apriori, Eclat
