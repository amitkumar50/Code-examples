* A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the following:
* It is an empty string "", or a single character not equal to "(" or ")",
* It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
* It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.
* We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:
```c
Example-1
Input: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1"
Output: 3
Explanation: Digit 8 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.

Example-2
Input: s = "(1)+((2))+(((3)))"
Output: 3

Example-3
Input: s = "1+(2*3)/(2-1)"
Output: 1
```

=== Code
==== CPP
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(string s) {
        unsigned long out = 0;
        stack<char> st;
        
        for (auto i:s) {
            if (i == '(')
                st.push(i);

            out = max(st.size(), out);

            if (i==')')
                st.pop();
        }

        return out;
    }
};
```
