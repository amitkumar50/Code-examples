## Dynamic Programming
- This is a algorithmic paradigm that solves a complex problem by breaking it into sub-problems and stores the results of sub-problems to avoid computing the same results again.

 If a node x lies in the shortest path from a source node u to destination node v then the shortest path from u to v is combination of shortest path from u to x and shortest path from x to v.
