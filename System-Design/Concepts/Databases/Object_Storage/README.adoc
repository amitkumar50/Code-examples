== Why store images,video on Object store?
Object store & distributed file storage system are optimized for serving large binary files efficiently. How?
* *1. Data Sharding and Distribution:* Object storage systems break large files into smaller chunks or objects. These objects are distributed across multiple servers or nodes within the storage cluster. This distribution allows for parallelism in data retrieval, improving read performance.
* *2. HTTP-Based Access:* Object storage is typically accessed via HTTP(S) protocols. This means that clients can retrieve objects using HTTP GET requests.
* *3. Better Caching at CDN:* The use of HTTP also enables the use of content delivery networks (CDNs) for caching and global distribution of content, further improving access times.
* *4. Data Compression:* Data is compressed which reduces storage footprint of large files and optimize the use of storage resources.
* *5. Geo-Replication:* For global accessibility, object storage systems may support geo-replication.

== How Object Store (should) be storing data?
```c
  hashmap  <key=video_id, value = vector<meta_data_virtual_address, video_file_virtual_address>>
  
  |Video_id     |Virtual Address of Video File in Memory|
  |-------------|---------------------------------------|
  | 2412as      |           0x004                       |
  | aw1as2      |           0x505                       |       

// Similar for photos
```

== Examples of Object Store
=== Amazon S3(Simple Storage Service)
S3 stores everything in buckets. each bucket can have 100's of objects. Example: There is 1 large Video, We will store Video chunks on S3.
```c
  <key=bucket-id, Value=Video_url(or video)>
      11, xyz
      12, abc
      ..
```

* *S3 Storage classes*
|===
|Class|What

|1. S3|Durable, immediately available and frequently accessed
|2. S3-IA(Infrequently accessed)|For data that is accessed less frequently
|3. S3 â€“ RRS (Reduced Redundancy Storage)| Less durable with availabilty. Used for data that is easily reproducible, such thumbnails

==== ODL/Object Definition Language
ODL is Independent of any programming language and helps to create classes and interfaces and also Specify a database schema.

==== OQL/Object Query Language
This is similar to SQL with additional features (object identity, complex objects, operations, inheritance, polymorphism, relationships)
