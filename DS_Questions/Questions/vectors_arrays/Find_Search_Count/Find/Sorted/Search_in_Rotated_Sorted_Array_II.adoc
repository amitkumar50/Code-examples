- There is an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values).
- Before being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (0-indexed). For example, `[0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become `[4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4]`

== Approach-1. Binary Search
=== Logic
* 1. Use binary search
* 2. If the elements at mid, left, and right are equal, skip all duplicate elements (This is done using while and linearly)
* 3. Is left half of array is sorted & target is in left subarray, then search in left
* 4. else search in right

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool search(vector<int>& v, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = v.size() - 1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (v[mid] == target)
                return true;

            //If the elements at mid, left, and right are equal 
            //increment left and decrement right to handle duplicates.
            if (v[mid] == v[left] && v[mid] == v[right]) {
                while (left <= right && v[left] == v[mid])
                    ++left;
                
                // Move the right pointer to the leftmost non-duplicate element.
                while (left <= right && v[right] == v[mid])
                    --right;
            }
            // Now we donot have any duplicate elements
            // This means left half of array is sorted
            // Eg: 2 3 4 5 0 1
            //        mid
            else if (v[mid] >= v[left]) {
                // if target is in left subarray ie between left and mid
                // search in left half only right=mid-1
                if (v[left] <= target && target < v[mid])
                    right = mid - 1;
                else
                    left = mid + 1;
            } 
            //Condition: v[mid] < v[left]. This means right half is sorted
            //Eg: 8 9 10 0 1 2 3.      target=2
            //          mid
            else {
                //if target is in right half, search in right
                //else search in left half
                if (v[mid] < target && target <= v[right])
                    left = mid + 1;
                else
                    right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
