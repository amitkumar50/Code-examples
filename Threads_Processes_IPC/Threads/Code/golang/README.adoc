== go routine(Threads)
* A goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution managed by the Go runtime. 
* Goroutines are inexpensive to create and manage, and they can be used to improve the performance of concurrent programs.
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func sayHello() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from goroutine!")
}

func main() {
    // Start a goroutine
    go sayHello()

    // Print from the main goroutine
    fmt.Println("Hello from main!")

    // Sleep for a while to allow the goroutine to execute
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
}

$ go run main.go
Hello from main!
Hello from goroutine!
```
