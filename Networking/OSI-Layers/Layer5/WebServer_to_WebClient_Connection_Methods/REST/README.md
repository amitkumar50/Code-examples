## REST / (Representation State Transfer) APIs
- **What?**
  - When web-client calls Restful APIs then Web-Server will transfer data representing state of the requested resource. Representation can be in [JSON](/Languages/ScriptingLanguages/JavaScript) or HTML or [XML](/Languages/Markup_Language) format
- **Web Service?** 
  - Process/Service run by web server hosted over cloud that provides any information needed. Eg: Whether report.
```c
    Web Client                                  {Web Service} On US Server
  rest-api call() ----Give me Temp of NY------>    |
                 <-NY temp (JSON or XML format)--- |        
//Now-a-days RESTful API are used. Before REST everyone was using SOAP.
```
