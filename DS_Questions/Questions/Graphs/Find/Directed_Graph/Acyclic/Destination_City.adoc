== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/destination-city/description/[1436. Destination City]
You are given the array paths, where paths[i] = [cityAi, cityBi] means there exists a direct path going from cityAi to cityBi. Return the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another city.

It is guaranteed that the graph of paths forms a line without any loop, therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.
```c
Example 1:
Input: paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]
Output: "Sao Paulo" 
Explanation: Starting at "London" city you will reach "Sao Paulo" city which is the destination city. Your trip consist of: "London" -> "New York" -> "Lima" -> "Sao Paulo".

Example 2:
Input: paths = [["B","C"],["D","B"],["C","A"]]
Output: "A"
Explanation: All possible trips are: 
"D" -> "B" -> "C" -> "A". 
"B" -> "C" -> "A". 
"C" -> "A". 
"A". 
Clearly the destination city is "A".
```

== Approach-1. Create graph
=== Logic
* Create a graph of nodes which have outdegree>=1
* Create set of all nodes(ie nodes which have outdegree>=1 + nodes which have outdegree=0)
* Traverse graph and remove corresponding node from set.
* Now set should have only 1 element left, that element is the node which does not have any outdegree

=== Complexity
* Time: O(n)
* Space: 2O(n)

=== Code

class Solution {
public:
    string destCity(vector<vector<string>>& paths) {
        unordered_set<string> umNodesHavingOutdegree;
        unordered_set<string> usAllCities;

        for (int i=0;i<paths.size();++i) {
            umNodesHavingOutdegree.insert(paths[i][0]);
            // Insert all nodes into usCities
            usAllCities.insert(paths[i][0]);
            usAllCities.insert(paths[i][1]);
        }
        // Remove all nodes from usAllCities which has outdegree
        for (auto city:umNodesHavingOutdegree) {
            auto it = usAllCities.find(city);
            if (it != usAllCities.end())
                usAllCities.erase(it);
