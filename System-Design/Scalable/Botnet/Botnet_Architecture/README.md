## Botnet Architecture
- Botmaster sends malicious software through a propagation mechanism.
- After being infected, these machines becomes SLAVES and may be used as attacking platforms against other vulnerable hosts or to carry out denial of service attacks.
- **Command-and-control infrastructure (C&C)** This is control entity that can be either centralized or decentralized. One or more communication protocols
are used by the botmaster(s) to command slave computers and coordinate their actions.
