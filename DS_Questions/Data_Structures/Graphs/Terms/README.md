## Terms
- *Diameter/Eccentricity:* Greatest distance between any pair of vertices.
- *Edge/Arc/Line:* Links connecting the nodes. Links can be directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted. Weight also means cost.
- *Radius:* Minimum eccentricity of any vertex.
- **[Topological Sorting](Topological_Sorting)**
- *Vertex/Node:* Interconnected objects are called vertices.
