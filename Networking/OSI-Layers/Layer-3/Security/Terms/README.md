## Terms
- **[Cryptanalysis?](Cryptanalysis)** Breaking ciphers. 
- **Decryption?** All steps are run in reverse order of encryption.
- **Kerckhoffâ€™s principle?** Whole world should know how crypto algorithm works, All algorithms must be public. Algorithm is parameterized by key only the keys are secret
- **Rounds?** There are more P-boxes at start and end.
- **Whitening?** XORing a random 64-bit key with plaintext before feeding it into Encryptor and then XORing a second 64-bit key with the resulting ciphertext before transmitting it. DES uses it.
