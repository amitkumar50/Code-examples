Given the root of a binary tree, construct a string consisting of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversal way, and return it.

Omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that do not affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.

Examples
```c
     1
   /  \  
  2    3
 /
4 
Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
Explanation: Originally, it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be "1(2(4))(3)"

Example-2
      1
     / \
    2   3
    \
     4
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"
Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, except we cannot omit the first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between the input and the output.
```

== Approach-1. Traverse preorder
=== Logic
* Take out string.
* During preorder traversal, insert following as you reach node.
```
  out += '(';
```
* if node has both left, right children, jump to left, right
* if left=null, right!=null children. Insert ()

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
    string out;
public:
    string tree2str(TreeNode* root) {
        preorder(root);
        // Since we donot need opening bracket of string '(', take substr from 1st position.
        return out.substr(1, out.size()-1);
    }
    void preorder(TreeNode* p) {
        if (!p)
            return;
        out += "(";        
        out += to_string(p->val);
        if (p->left) {
            preorder (p->left);
            out += ")";
        }
        if (p->right) {
            if (!p->left)
                out += "()";
            preorder (p->right);
            out += ")";
        }
    }
};
```
