### Subsequence (non-contiguous)
- Subsequence is a new string generated from original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. 
```
s = "It was the best of times"
subsequence = "Itwastimes"
```

<a name=s2></a>
### Substring (always contiguous)
```c
substring = "the best of"
```
