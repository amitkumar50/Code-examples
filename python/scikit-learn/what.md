## Scikit-learn?
  - Helps is data processing
  - It includes tools for data preprocessing and data mining
  
### Data Standardization
  - Problem: Data can contain all sorts of different values makeing it difficult to interpret.. Example:
    1. Olympic 100m sprint times will range from 9.5 to 10.5 seconds
    2. calorie counts in large pepperoni pizzas can range from 1500 to 3000 calories.
  - Solution: convert the data into a Standard Format(SF) to make it easier to understand
    - process of converting data into this format is called data standardization.
  - Standardizeing data
    - data value = x
    - mean = μ
    - overall standard deviation, σ.
```
z = (x - μ)
    
```
