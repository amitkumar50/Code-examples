## Probaly fake at time of creation:
- 1. Registration using default values
- 2. 5+ registration from same IP address
- 3. Any of security attacks

## Fake exisiting account: (monitoring traffic)
- 1. User uploading vulgur/voilent/controversial videos/images on his account
- 2. sending 100's of friend requests/min(maybe bot)
- 3. constantly updating timeline(may be bot)
- 4. forged/corped pictures. half cutted/vulgar profile pictures.
- 5. The profile has very few pictures or no actual picture of a person at all.
- 6. It was created recently – in the past year or two. Unless the person is very young, most of us opened our Facebook accounts in 2006-2007.
- 7. Little or no contacts in common. When the profile has nothing in common with you such as friends or even a professional interest, and they are trying to add you, it’s likely for malicious reasons.
- 8. When a profile adds you but once you accept them, there is no more interaction with that user. He/she wanted and will avoid talking to you in the hopes you forget about it. so that he can monitor your activities.
