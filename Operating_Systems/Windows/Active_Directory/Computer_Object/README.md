## Computer Object
In Simple terms this is Computer account maintained on ADDS for all computers which are joined to AD. Computer accounts are used in the same ways that user accounts are used for users. Each computer has a Security Identification (SID) and attributes. Every member computer in an AD DS domain maintains a computer account with a user name (sAMAccountName) and password, just like a user account does.
