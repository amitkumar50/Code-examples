== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/find-center-of-star-graph/description[1791. Find Center of Star Graph]
There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly n - 1 edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between the nodes ui and vi. Return the center of the given star graph.

```c
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.

== Approach-1. O(1)
=== Logic
* Find common point in edge[0] and edge[1] and return

=== Complexity
* Time: O(1)
* Space: O(1)

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findCenter(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int point00 = edges[0][0], point01 = edges[0][1];
        int point10 = edges[1][0], point11 = edges[1][1];

        if (point00 == point10)
            return point10;
        if (point00 == point11)
            return point11;
        return point01;
    }
};
```

==== Rust
```rs
impl Solution {
    pub fn find_center(edges: Vec<Vec<i32>>) -> i32 {
        let point00 = edges[0][0];
        let point01 = edges[0][1];
        let point10 = edges[1][0];
        let point11 = edges[1][1]; 

        if point00 == point10 {
            return point10;
        }
        if point00 == point11 {
            return point11;
        }
        point01
    }
}
```

==== Go
```go
func findCenter(edges [][]int) int {
        point00 := edges[0][0]
        point01 := edges[0][1]
        point10 := edges[1][0]
        point11 := edges[1][1]

        if point00 == point10 {
            return point10
        }
        if point00 == point11 {
            return point11
        }
        return point01
}
```

==== Python
```py
class Solution:
    def findCenter(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        point00 = edges[0][0]
        point01 = edges[0][1]
        point10 = edges[1][0]
        point11 = edges[1][1]

        if point00 == point10:
            return point10
        
        if point00 == point11:
            return point11
        
        return point01
```
