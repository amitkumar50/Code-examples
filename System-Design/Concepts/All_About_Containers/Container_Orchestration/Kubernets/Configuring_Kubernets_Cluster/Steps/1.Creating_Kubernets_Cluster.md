## Kubernets cluster
- **What?** Machines are configured in cluster and clusters becomes part of kubernets. Kubernetes automates the distribution and scheduling of application containers across a cluster.

### Nodes types in kubernets cluster
#### 1. Master Node
  - **What?** Manages the cluster
  - **Responsibilites of master?** 
    - Scheduling applications
    - Maintaining application's desired states
    - Scaling applications
    - Rolling out new updates.
    
#### 2. Worker Nodes
  - **What?** These runs the applications.
  - **How?** 
    - Each worker node has daemon called **Kubelet**(agent for managing the node and communicating with the Kubernetes master).
    - Worker nodes communicate with the master using the Kubernetes API, which the master exposes
  - **Architecture?**        
```c
                                      Worker-Node
                                      (kubelet) calls API-1(a,b)                     
      Master-Node
      API-1,API-2
                                
                                Worker-Node
                                (kubelet) calls API-2(b,c)
                                
```

## Installing/Starting Kubernets cluster using minikube
> minikube is lightweight Kubernetes implementation that creates a VM on your local machine and deploys a simple cluster containing only one node.
```bash
$ install

$ minikube version                              //Check version
  minikube version: v1.8.1
  
$ minikube start                                //Start minikube kubernets cluster

$ kubectl version
  Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"17"...}    //Worker node version
  Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"17",..}      //Master node version

$ kubectl get nodes                                       //How many nodes are in kubernetes cluster
NAME       STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
minikube   Ready    master   2m    v1.17.3
```
