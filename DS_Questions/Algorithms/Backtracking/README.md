## [Backtracking LC Explore Cards](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-ii/472/backtracking/2654/)
- Backtracking uses Recursion & it is an algorithmic paradigm aimed to improve the time complexity of the [Naive/Brute Force](..) **if possible**.
- Backtracking **can be imagined** same as tree traversal where we start from root node to search for solutions that are located at the leaf nodes.
- Each node represents a partial candidate to final solution, At each node. Once we can determine if a certain node cannot possibly lead to a final solution, we abandon the current node and backtrack to its parent node to explore other possibilities.
- **How?** Backtracking does not generate all possible solutions, it checks if condition fails, the solution is rejected and the next solution is tried.

### Examples
#### Example-1
We are given a set of words represented in the form of a tree. Find word `AIM`.

#### Example-2: Finding path in a maze from start point to destination.
Select one way and try to move forward towards the destination. if we reach a point where we canâ€™t move towards the destination?
  - Backtrack on path and try to explore other paths.

### Backtracking Template
Most of BT problems can be solved using below pattern.
```c
    vec<> solutions;
    
    void recursive_backtrack(int row, int col, &candidate){
      if (base_case reached){                  //Base case.
        solutions.push_back (solution);        //Copy solution-1 into solutions vector
        return;
      }
      
      for (candidate in candidate list) {
        if (candidate not valid)
          continue;
        else {                                                    //VALID candidate
          solution.push_back (candidate);                         //Place this candidate on 1 solution
          recursive_backtrack (next_candidate=candidate+1);      //Try next candidate
          remove (candidate);                                    //Mark this as unvisited, Unflag this node.
        }
      }
    }
    
    return-type solve (int n) {
        create-1st-candidate;
        recursive_backtrack (start, end, 1stcandidate);             //Start from row=0,col=0
        return vecs_final_board;
    }
    
    main () {
      solve(n);
    }
```

### Time Complexity
- BT is unfolded as a **DFS traversal in a n-ary tree**.
- **Time Complexity:** (Max Number of nodes on 1 level) x (Number of levels).
- So, How many number of nodes?
```c
  1st iteration = n elements
  T = target value
  O(n ^ T)
```
- Varies on approach taken by backtracking algo.
  - O(mn): Word Search in Maze
  - O(2<sup>n</sup>) < O(n!)
