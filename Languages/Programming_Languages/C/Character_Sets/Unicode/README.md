  - Unicode has (1lac 10k points= 21bits) to represent 1lac 10k different characters.
    - `0 - 127` are same as [ASCII](..)
    - `128-255` contains currency symbols and other common signs.
    - `256-799` Accented characters.
    - `880-` Greek letters, then Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, Indic scripts, and Thai.
