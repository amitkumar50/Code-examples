== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-integers-by-the-number-of-1-bits[1356. Sort Integers by The Number of 1 Bits]
You are given an integer array arr. Sort the integers in the array in ascending order by the number of 1's in their binary representation and in case of two or more integers have the same number of 1's you have to sort them in ascending order.

Return the array after sorting it.
```c
Example 1:
Input: arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
Explantion: [0] is the only integer with 0 bits.
[1,2,4,8] all have 1 bit.
[3,5,6] have 2 bits.
[7] has 3 bits.
The sorted array by bits is [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1024,512,256,128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1]
Output: [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024]
Explantion: All integers have 1 bit in the binary representation, you should just sort them in ascending order.
```

== Approach-1
=== Logic
* Iterate thru the array, count number of on bits in element of the number.
* Take a `map<number_of_on_bits, vector<numbers>> m`
* Populate map m after iterating thru the input array. 
* Iterate thru map m and fill the output array. Sort map m.second(ie vector) before putting elements in out vector.

=== Complexity
* *Time:* O(nlogn)
** O(n)*32. To calculate On bits in a number
** O(nlogn). Sort
* *Space:* O(n). map of same size as input array. 

=== Code
==== CPP
```c
class Solution {
    int CountOnes(uint32_t a){
        uint32_t i = 1, k = 1;
        int ones = 0;
        while (k++ != sizeof(uint32_t)*8) {           //sizeof(uint32_t) = 4
            if (a & i)
                ones++;
            i = i<<1;
        }
        return ones;
    }
public:
    vector<int> sortByBits(vector<int>& arr) {
        map<int, vector<int>> m;
        for_each(arr.begin(), arr.end(), [&](int ele){
            // Count on bits
            int key = CountOnes(ele);
            auto it = m.find(key);
            vector<int> temp;
            if (it == m.end()) {
                temp.push_back(ele);
                m.insert({key, temp});
            } else {
                it->second.push_back(ele);
            }
        });

        vector<int> out;
        for_each(m.begin(), m.end(), [&](auto ele){
            //sort each vector 1st
            sort(ele.second.begin(), ele.second.end());
            for (auto it=ele.second.begin(); it!=ele.second.end(); ++it)
                out.push_back(*it);
        });
        return out;
    }
};
```
