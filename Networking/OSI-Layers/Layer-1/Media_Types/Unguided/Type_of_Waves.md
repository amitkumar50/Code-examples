## Medium Of Unguided Communication = Waves
- Radio, microwave, infrared, and visible light portions of the spectrum can all be used for transmitting information by modulating the amplitude, frequency, or phase of the waves.
- **UV light, X-rays, gamma rays**
  - These are even better, due to their higher frequencies
  - But they are hard to produce and modulate, do not propagate well through buildings, and are dangerous to living things.
