* HBase is modeled after [Googleâ€™s BigTable] and runs on top of link:System-Design/Concepts/DistributedSystems/Batch_Processing/README.adoc[Hadoop Distributed File System]
* Written in Java.
* **Writes Data only Once**
  - HBase groups data together to store new data in a memory buffer and, once the buffer is full, it dumps the data to the disk.
