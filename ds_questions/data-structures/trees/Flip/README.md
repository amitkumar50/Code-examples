## Flip(Turn over)
- **What**
  - Flip can happen on any node. It does not mean complete BT need to be flipped.
  - Donot confuse Flip with Mirror(where complete BT is turned on paper 180 degrees)
- **How to Flip**
  - Just exchange left and right nodes.
- **Example**
```c
a. Flip at node=1
                           
      1                    1
    /  \                 /  \
   2    3   =>          3    2
   \     \              \     \        
    4     5              5     4 
                           
b. Flip at node=3
      1                   1
     / \                 /  \
    3   2   =>          3    2
    \    \             /      \
     5    4           5        4
```
