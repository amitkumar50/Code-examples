|combobox|used for building forms in HTML. It is formed with select element and input type=”text” element.
|<dl> (description lists)|set of items and their associated descriptions, such as terms and definitions, or questions and answers

<dl>
  <dt>soliloquy</dt>		Description Term
  <dd>				Description Definition
    In drama, where a character speaks to themselves, representing their inner
    thoughts or feelings and in the process relaying them to the audience (but

  </dd>
</dl>
``
|<!DOCTYPE html>| The doctype. The doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything else to work right.
|<div>
a|
* Is a block level non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think of a better semantic block element to use, or don't want to add any specific meaning. For example, imagine a shopping cart widget that you could choose to pull up at any point during your time on an e-commerce site. Now this widget is not <aside>, as it doesn't necessarily relate to the main content. This widget is also not <section>, as it isn't part of the main content of the page. So a <div> is fine in this case
* *Warning:* Divs are so convenient to use that it's easy to use them too much. As they carry no semantic value, they just clutter your HTML code. Take care to use them only when there is no better semantic solution and try to reduce their usage to the minimum otherwise you'll have a hard time updating and maintaining your documents.
|<footer>|The footer is also sometimes used for SEO purposes, by providing links for quick access to popular content.
``
<body>

``
|<hr>|Horizontal line. used to separate content. Add a line
|h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6:Headings|Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages
|<header>|Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and perhaps a tagline. This usually stays the same from one webpage to another.
``
<body>
    <header style="display: flex; align-items: center">	//Align all elements at center
      <h1 >Birdwatching</h1>
      <img src="dove.png" alt="a simple dove logo">		//image on right side of text
    </header>
</body>

//style attribute is defined below
``
|<head></head>| Includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more.
|<html></html>|html element. This element wraps all the content on the page. It is also known as the root element
|<img>|Embed image into page. Search engines also read image filenames and count them towards SEO. Therefore, you should give your image a descriptive filename; dinosaur.jpg is better than img835.png.
``
<img
  src="images/dinosaur.jpg"
  alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton. it has a large head with long sharp teeth" 
  width="400"		//width height in pixels
  height="341"
  title="A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum"	//supporting information, seen on mouse hover
/>
//src: location of image
//alt: Alternate text: Its value is supposed to be a textual description of the image, for use in situations where the image cannot be seen/displayed.
Why use <alt> at all?
- The user is visually impaired, and is using a screen reader to read the web out to them.
- The browser doesn't support the image type. Some people still use text-only browsers, such as Lynx, which displays the alt text of images.
- Search engines match alt text with search queries.
- Users have turned off images to reduce data transfer volume and distractions. This is especially common on mobile phones
``
|<input>|used to create interactive controls for web forms. It can take various types, each defining a specific kind of user input
``
<form class="guess-form">
    <label for="guessField">Enter a guess: </label>
    <input type="number" min="1" max="100" required id="guessField" class="guessField">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit guess" class="guessSubmit">
</form>
//type="number" indicates that the input should accept numeric values. Other common types include text, password, checkbox, radio, etc
``
|label|defines a label for several elements. provide a usability improvement for mouse users
|lang|lang attribute inside the `<html>` tag, to declare the language of the Web page. To assist search engines and browsers
|link|The <link> element should always go inside the head of your document. This takes two attributes, rel="stylesheet", which indicates that it is the document's stylesheet, and href, which contains the path to the stylesheet file
|list (<ul> unordered list)|<ul>this wraps around all the list items. Then <li> wraps around 
|<main>|main content of page.Use <main> only once per page, and put it directly inside <body>. Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.
```
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>eggs</li>
  <li>bread</li>
  <li>hummus</li>
</ul>
```
|list (<ol> ordered list)|<ol>This is just same as list, but all elements are ordered
```
<ol>
  <li>get up</li>
  <li>fresh</li>
  <li>excercise</li>
  <li>breakfast</li>
</ol>
```
|<meta>|This element represents metadata.
``
<meta 
    charset="utf-8"			//specifies the character encoding for your document as UTF-8
    name="author" content="Chris Mills"	//key(name of author), value(name of author)
    name="description" content="...."	//This is shown in google search
/>
``
|<nav>|Contains the main navigation functionality for the page. Secondary links, etc., would not go in the navigation.
|p|Paragraph. Starts with newline & is block of text.
|<pre>|Defines preformatted text. text inside a `<pre>` element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks
|span|We use it to wrap content when we want to apply CSS to it. Text inside span looks like h1.
|<time datetime="2016-01-20">20 January 2016</time>|can be written in different formats
```
<span style="font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0; display: block;">
  Is this a top level heading?
</span>
```
|script| <script> element should also go into the head, and should include a src attribute containing the path to the JavaScript you want to load
|<span>| When we cannot find a better semantic text element to wrap the content, then use span. Should be used preferably with a suitable class attribute, to provide some kind of label for them so they can be easily targeted.
|<title></title>| The <title> element. This sets the title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in.
|===

=== style
To add color, font, size, and more. https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_styles.asp
```html
<p style="color:red;font-size:300%;"> .. </p>
<body style="background-color:powderblue;">		//Background of page
```

=== Attributes of element
Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. Example img tag can have following attributes:
* src(required): Tells the location of the image.
* alt: specifies a text description of the image
* width: specifies the width of the image etc

==== boolean attributes
Attributes written without values. Boolean attributes can only have one value, which is generally the same as the attribute name. Example:
* disabled: assign to form input elements. (You use this to disable the form input elements so the user can't make entries)
```html
<!-- using the disabled attribute prevents the end user from entering text into the input box -->
<input type="text" disabled />
```

=== title
Defines some extra information about an element. The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element
```html
				<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
```

== Formatting elements
|===

|`<b>` |Bold text
|<strong>|Important text
|<i>|Italic text
|<em>|Emphasized text
|<mark>|Marked text
|<small>|Smaller text
|<del>|Deleted text
|<ins>|Inserted text
|<sub>|Subscript text
|<sup>|Superscript text
|===

== Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
* Used to format the layout of a webpage. With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements
* CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

=== 1. Inline
using the style attribute inside HTML elements
```c
<h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">A red paragraph.</p>
```

=== 2. Internal
- using `<style>` element in the `<head>` section. Example:
```c
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {background-color: powderblue;}
h1   {color: blue;}
p    {color: red;}
</style>
</head>
<body>	
```

=== 3. External (`<link>` in `<head>`)
- An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.
- To use an external style sheet, add a `<link>` to it in the `<head>` section of each HTML page
```c
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
- style.css
```c
body {
  background-color: powderblue;
}
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
  border: 2px solid powderblue;		<!--CSS border property defines a border around an HTML element-->
  padding: 30px;			<!--defines a padding (space) between the text and the border-->
  margin: 50px;				<!--defines a margin (space) outside the border-->
  
}
```

== link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started#alt[Anatomy of an HTML document]
- See description of tags above
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is my page</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

== Debugging HTML page errors
* 1. Feed your page address into link:https://validator.w3.org/[Markup Validation Service]. This webpage takes an HTML document as an input, goes through it, and gives you a report to tell you what is wrong with your HTML.
* 2. Inspector. Press F12 on page.
