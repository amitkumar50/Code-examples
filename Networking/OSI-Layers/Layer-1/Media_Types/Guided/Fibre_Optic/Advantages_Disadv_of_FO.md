## Advantages
- Not affected by power surges, electromagnetic waves, power failure
- Light Weight

## Disadvantages
- New technology(not known to engineers)
- Will broke if bend too much
- Otical transmission is inherently unidirectional, two-way communication requires either two fibers or two frequency bands on one fiber.
