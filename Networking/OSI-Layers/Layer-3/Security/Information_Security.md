## Information Security
- Consitutues of 4 parts:
  - A. Secrecy/Confidentiality/Encryption
  - B. Authentication: whom you are talking to before revealing sensitive information
  - C. Nonrepudiation: Sender cannot deny that he has not sent the message.
  - D. Integrity: message you received was really the one sent and not something that a malicious adversary Encryption + Integrity
  
### A. ENCRYPTION/CRYPTOGRAPHY/CONFIDENTIALITY 
- **What?** Conversion of Data/Plain-text into unreadable/cipher text.
- **Why DL layer encryption/Link Encryption is not good idea?** 
  - With this approach packets have to be decrypted at each router, leaving them vulnerable to attacks from within the router.
- **Cryptanalysis?** Breaking ciphers. 
- **Kerckhoffâ€™s principle?** Whole world should know how crypto algorithm works, All algorithms must be public. Algorithm is parameterized by key only the keys are secret
- **CIPHER ALGORITHMS**
  - **1. Substitution Cipher:** each letter or group of letters is replaced by another letter or group of letters. Eg: Caesar ciphers(b becomes E, c becomes F)
  - **2. Block Ciphers(Mostly used):** Encrypt block of characters        
  - **2. Stream Ciphers(Obsolete):** Encrypt Single character at a time
- **How Encryption is performed at H/W Level?** ONLY POSITION OF BITS ARE CHANGED
  - A. PERMUTATION/P-BOX/TRANSPOSITION BOX: Perform internal transposition(change place) and do it at practically the speed of light since no computation is involved, just signal propagation. Internal wiring is not known to world.
  - B. SUBSTITUTION/S-BOX: This can have multiple stages of P-box inside providing more complex method bit position shifting. 
  - Product Cipher
    - Actual Cipher can use multiple P,S box stages inside to provide better cryptography. With large number of stages output can be a complicated function of the input. 
    - Actual implementations have minimum of 10 stages.
    - There are more P-boxes at start and end, called Rounds.

### How safe is 128 bit Key?
- The longer the key, higher work to be done by breaking algo.    {Email: 64-bit keys will do, Commercial applications: 128 bits, Govt org: 256 bits}
```c
    bits    No of Unique keys
    2                4
    3                8
    32            4,294,967,296    (4 billion)
    64            18,446,744,073,709,551,616 (18 Quintillion keys) = 18 x 1018
    128           340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456   ( 340,282,366,920,938,463,463 Quintillion keys) 
```    
- 1 super computer can perform 10<sup>17</sup> FLOPS (a hundred quadrillion FLOPS floating point operations per second)
  - Per Year = 3600(hour) x 24 x 30 x 12 = 31,104,000 x  10<sup>17</sup>= 31,104,00 Quintillion Operations.
  - 340,282,366,920,938,463,463 / 31,104,000 = 109,401,481,134,561 (approx) = 109 Trillion 
**109 Trillion super computers working parallelly for 1 year can produce all combinations of 128 bit key**
