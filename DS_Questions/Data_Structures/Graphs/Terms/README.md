  ## Terms
  - **Cyclic:** If graph has cycle.  
  - **Acyclic:** No cycles in graph. When following the graph from node to node, you will never visit the same node twice.
    - **[DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph)](DAG)**
  - **Directionality** 
    - Undirected/1 way: 1 side know other but viceversa not true. `[1] --> [2] --> [3]`
      - Ex: a. Fans knows celebrity but other side does not. b.  On Facebook the graph of friends is undirected.
    - Digraph/Bidirectional: Both sides know each other.  `[1] -- [2] -- [3]`
  - **Edge/Arc/Line?** Links connecting the nodes. Links can be directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted. Weight also means cost.
  - **Vertex/Node?** Interconnected objects are called vertices.
