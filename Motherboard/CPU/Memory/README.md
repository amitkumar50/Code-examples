CPU-Registers  L1-Cache/SRAM   L2-Cache/SRAM   L3-Cache/DRAM    Physical_Memory/RAM/Main Memory  Hard_Disk/Secondary_Memory

> Processor can only Run the program If it is on the RAM
- *1. CPU Registers*
- *2. Caches:* L1, L2, L3
- *3. Physical Memory / RAM / Main Memory:* Volatile(looses content at power off)
- *4. Virtual Memory / Hard Disk / Secondary Memory:* Non volatile

- **TYPES OF RAM**
  - DRAM(DYNAMIC RAM): Made from capacitors. Capacitors cannot hold charge for long. We have to refresh them with electricity to hold the information.
  - SRAM(SYNCHRONOUS DRAM): This also has capacitors. SRAM is faster than DRAM. It runs in sync with system clock.
