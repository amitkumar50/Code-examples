## Template/Generic Programming
- **What?** 
	- Writing a code that is independent of particular type.
	- Template is compiler abstraction.
	- Compiler creates the overloaded functions(specialization) for each type at compile time. Eg seperate for long int, short int, int, double, string.
	- Specialization 
		- Benefits: Makes code type-safe.
		- Drawbacks: increases sizeof object file(But not much because compiler achieves using optimizations & inlining).
- **Types of templates?**
	- *1. Function template:* Generic function that can be called/worked without particular type
	- *2. Class template:* Class having
		- Generic Member variables
		- Generic Member functions
	- *3. Template specialization:* Giving special implementation for specific data type of class and Generic for all others. Types:
		- Explicit/Full Specialization
		- Partial Specialization
