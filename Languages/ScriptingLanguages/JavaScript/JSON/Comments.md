## JSON Comments
- There are no comments in a JSON document. Reasons:
  - JSON parsers had difficulties supporting comments.
  - People were abusing comments. For example, Comments were being used for parsing directives, which would have destroyed interoperability.
  - Removing comments simplified and enabled cross-platform JSON support.
