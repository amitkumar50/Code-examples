### Types of Twisted Pair
### 1. CAT5 / Category5 / LAN / Ethernet
  - Deployed in many office buildings.
  - (100 Mbps) Uses two (out of the four) pairs, one pair for each direction.
  - (1 GBps) Uses all four pairs in both directions simultaneously.

|Ethernet Name|Speed|
|---|---|
|10/100|100 Megabits/sec|
|10/100/1000|1000 Megabits/sec = 1 GigaBits/sec|

### 2. CAT6 / Category6 / 10Gpbs / UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)
  - Has greater bandwidth with more twists/meter.

### 3. CAT7 / Category7 / (Shielded Twisted Pair)
  - Has shielding on the individual twisted pairs, as well as around the entire cable (but inside the plastic protective sheath).
  - Shielding reduces the susceptibility to external interference and crosstalk with other nearby cables
