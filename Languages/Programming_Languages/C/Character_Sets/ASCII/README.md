## ASCII / American Standard Code of Information Exchange
- Earliest character encoding system.
- **Drawback**
  - _1._ Only includes 127 characters, if some country eg(European Chinese, Korean, and many other languages) want to include their characters there is no space.
  - _2._ All microprocessors work with powers of 2, sending 7 bits make them inefficient, instead 8 bits should be sent.
