## Modules
- Similar to [namespaces in c++](/Languages/Programming_Languages/c++)
- Modules organizes code within a crate into groups for ease of use.
- Code inside module can be functions, enums, structs etc.
- By default Functions within modules are private ie to access function and we need to make it public by placing `pub` in front of it.
