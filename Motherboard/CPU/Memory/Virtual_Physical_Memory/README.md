## Virtual Memory
- **Why VM?** Now-a-days processes are RAM hungry. every other program(eg: adobe photoshop, microsoft teams) need more RAM. if 10 such processes want to run simultaneously then 10GB RAM is needed which is not available. VM is illusion to program that it has complete access to RAM.
- **Paging** Process of dividing Hard-Disk to equal-sized blocks is called paging.
- **MMU(Memory Management unit)** Takes Virtual address(of Virtual Memory) as Input provides Physical Address(of RAM) as output ie translate virtual to physical address.
