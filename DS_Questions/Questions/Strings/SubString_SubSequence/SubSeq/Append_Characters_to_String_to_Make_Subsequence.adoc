== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/append-characters-to-string-to-make-subsequence/[2486. Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence]
You are given two strings s and t consisting of only lowercase English letters.

Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of s so that t becomes a subsequence of s.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

```c
Example 1:
Input: s = "coaching", t = "coding"
Output: 4
Explanation: Append the characters "ding" to the end of s so that s = "coachingding".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("coachingding").
It can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcde", t = "a"
Output: 0
Explanation: t is already a subsequence of s ("abcde").

Example 3:
Input: s = "z", t = "abcde"
Output: 5
Explanation: Append the characters "abcde" to the end of s so that s = "zabcde".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("zabcde").
It can be shown that appending any 4 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.
```

== Approach-1. Sliding Window. O(n)
=== Logic
* Start from i=0(for s), j=0(for t)
* skip all matching characters in s,t
  * if i reaches end, and j not there are some characters at end of t which need to be added to s. (return number of characters)

=== Complexity
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(1)
    
=== Code
==== CPP98
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int appendCharacters(string s, string t) {
        int i=0, j=0;
        if (s==t)
            return 0;
        while (i<s.size() && j<t.size()) {
            while (i < s.size() && j < t.size() && s[i] == t[j]) {
                i++;    j++;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return t.size()-j;
    }
};
```
