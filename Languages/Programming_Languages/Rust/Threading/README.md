### `Arc<T>` / Atomically Reference Counted
- [Meaning of Atomic.](/Threads_Processes_IPC/Terms) Arc is [reference counting](/Languages/Programming_Languages/Rust/Smart_Pointers/) pointer.
```rs
let mut a_atm:AtomicU32 = Atomic:U32::new(100);          //Create and Initialize Atomic variable(a_atm)
let mut b_atm:AtomicU32 = Atomic:U32::new(5);
```
- Structue T is allocated on Heap, `Arc<T>` provides shared ownership of a value of type T.
- **clone() on Arc** produces a new Arc instance, which points to the same allocation on the heap as the source Arc, only reference count is increased.
- When the last Arc pointer to a given allocation is destroyed, the value stored in that allocation (often referred to as “inner value”) is also dropped.
- **Mutable References** are not allowed inside Arc. Use `Arc<Mutex<Value>>` or `Arc<RwLock<Value>>`, Atomic types inside Arc if needed mutable references.
  - This is just wrapping Mutex inside Arc. We know in [Rust value & mutex are not seperate](/Threads_Processes_IPC/IPC/synchronization/Mutex#rs)

#### `Rc<T>` vs `Arc<T>`
Both are Reference counting Smart Pointers.
```rs
                        RC<T>                                Arc<T>

#### Passing mutable Reference to thread
```rs
main.rs
use std::sync{
  Arc, Mutex
}
use tokio;
pub struct Employee {
  age: i32,
}
impl Employee {
  pub fn new() -> Self {
    Employee {
      age: 40,
    }
  }
}
pub async fn thread1(emp: Arc<Mutex<&mut Employee>>) {                          //6. Collected Arc<Mutex<Employee>>
  let a = emp.lock().unwrap();                                                  //7. locked mutex to access value inside it
  println!("a={}",a);                                                           //40
}

pub async fn fun(emp: &mut Employee) {
  let arc_emp:Arc<Mutex<&mut Employee>> = Arc::new(Mutex::new(emp.clone()));    //3. Created Arc<Mutex> clone(). ie it points to original object
  let handle = tokio::spawn(async {                                             //4. Created Green Thread(User level Thread)
    thread1 (arc_emp).await;                                                    //5. passed Arc<Mutex<Employee>> to thread.
  });                                                                                Note we are not passing Arc<Mutex<&mut Employee>>
  let out = handle.await.unwrap();
  
  emp.age = 90;                                                                 //8. Original value inside struct is changed
  
  let arc_emp1:Arc<Mutex<&mut Employee>> = Arc::new(Mutex::new(emp.clone()));    //9. Created new Arc reference
  let handle1 = tokio::spawn(async {
    thread1 (arc_emp1).await;
  }
  let out1 = handle1.await.unwrap();                                            //10. a=90. ie Changed value is accessed using threads
}

#[tokio::main]
pub async fn main(){                  //All tokio functions should be async
  let mut emp = Employee new();   //1. Created struct
  fun (emp);                      //2. Passed mutable reference to function
}
```
