## Advantages of DNS
- *1.* To send packet across network we need IP Address and only DNS can provide.
- *2.* No need for memorizing IP addresses
## Disadv
- *1.* Registry only controlled by [ICANN](/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer5/Protocols/DNS/Terms/Domain_Name) which can become bais to some country/organization.
- *2.* [DNS Messages](/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer5/Protocols/DNS/DNS_Messages) does not have information of client asking the information, hacker can bisect the message and send his own message.
- *3.* [TLD's](/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer5/Protocols/DNS/Terms/Domain_Name) can be bottleneck.
