### Encryption at DL Layer
- Encryption at DL is called Link encryption.
- **Why is not good idea?** 
  - With this approach packets have to be decrypted at each router(in internet), leaving them vulnerable to attacks from within the router.
  
### Encryption at Application Layer?
- **Why this is bad idea?**
  - All application worldwide has to be security aware putting extra burden on application developers.

### Encryption at Transport Layer or between Transport and Application
- Not suitable place, Since Application layer security is already provided by SSL/TLS
