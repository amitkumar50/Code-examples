## Zookeeper
- ZooKeeper is a server that coordinates distributed processes by managing the following: naming, status information, configuration, location information, synchronization, failover, etc. The naming registry uses a hierarchical namespace that is similar to a filesystem.
- Kafka (as a distributed application) is designed to run within the ZooKeeper environment.
