## Long Pooling/Push Method/Hanging GET
- Server holds clientâ€™s connection open for as long as possible. Data is delivered to web client once becomes available or threshold timer expired.
- **Flow**
  - *a.* Client-server completes 3-way-handshake. Connection established.
  - *b.* Client asks data from server(page1). Data is not available at the moment. Connection is not closed.
  - *c.* Client asks page4 from server. Requests are pushed on queue.
  - *d.* Page1 becomes available, server sends page1 back to client
- **Disadv:**
  - Server may run out of file descriptor.
  - Each long pooling request has a timeout, client need to reconnect again to get the data.
- **Adv:** Latency is reduced.
