## 8086 PIN Diagram

- **Pins**
  - *CLK?* Clock input must have a duty cycle of 33% (high for 1/3 and low for 2/3s)
  - *VCC/GND?* Power supply (5V) and GND (0V).
  - *BHE?* Bus High Enable. Enables the most significant data bus bits (D 15 -D 8 ) during a read or write operation.
  - *S7, S6, S5, S4, S3, S2, S1, S0*
    - S4-S3: Indicate which segment is accessed during current bus cycle.
```html
  S4  S3  Function
  0   0   Extra segment(Heap)
  0   1   Stack
  1   0   code
  1   1   Data
```
  - *INTR?* When 1 Microprocessor prepares to service interrupt.
  - *INTA?* Interrupt Acknowledge generated by the microprocessor in response to INTR. Causes the interrupt vector to be put onto the data bus.
  - *NMI?* Non-maskable interrupt. Similar to INTR, this interrupt cannot be ignored need to be processed.
