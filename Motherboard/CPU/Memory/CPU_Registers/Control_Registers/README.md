## Control Registers / IP Flags
- **What?** Around 10 Control registers. IP flags which modify basic behavior of CPU.
- Length = 4byte(32 bit OS), 8byte(64 bit OS).
- IP FLAGS:   Flag Bits are 1 bit.
  - Overflow Flag (OF): indicates the overflow of a high-order bit (leftmost bit) of data after a signed arithmetic operation.
  - Direction Flag (DF): determines left or right direction for moving or comparing string data. When the DF value is 0, the string operation takes left-to-right direction and when the value is set to 1, the string operation takes right-to-left direction.
  - Interrupt Flag (IF): determines whether the external interrupts like keyboard entry, etc., are to be ignored or processed. It disables the external interrupt when the value is 0 and enables interrupts when set to 1.
  - Trap Flag (TF): allows setting the operation of the processor in single-step mode. The DEBUG program we used sets the trap flag, so we could step through the execution one instruction at a time.
  - Sign Flag (SF): shows the sign of the result of an arithmetic operation. This flag is set according to the sign of a data item following the arithmetic operation. The sign is indicated by the high-order of leftmost bit. A positive result clears the value of SF to 0 and negative result sets it to 1. In assembly you dont have "less than", "greater than" operators, You just subtract and check the results.
  - Zero Flag (ZF): indicates the result of an arithmetic or comparison operation. A nonzero result clears the zero flag to 0, and a zero result sets it to 1.
  - Auxiliary Carry Flag (AF): contains the carry from bit 3 to bit 4 following an arithmetic operation; used for specialized arithmetic. The AF is set when a 1-byte arithmetic operation causes a carry from bit 3 into bit 4.
  - Parity Flag (PF): indicates the total number of 1-bits in the result obtained from an arithmetic operation. An even number of 1-bits clears the parity flag to 0 and an odd number of 1-bits sets the parity flag to 1.
  - Carry Flag (CF): contains the carry of 0 or 1 from a high-order bit (leftmost) after an arithmetic operation. It also stores the contents of last bit of a shift or rotate operation
  - EFLAGS register:    This is collection of named bits.
