## Dictionaries
- These are Associative arrays, {key:value} pairs indexed by keys
- If we try entering value of existant key, the old value associated with that key is overwritten.
- Keys in Dictionary: Are immutable/RO/Unchangable/Unique
- Example of keys: 
  - strings and numbers
  - Tuples if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuple
  - Lists cannot be used as keys as lists can be modified in place using index assignment
