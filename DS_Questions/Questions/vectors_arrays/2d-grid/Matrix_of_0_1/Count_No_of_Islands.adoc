== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/[200. Number of Islands]
Given matrix '1's (land) and '0's (water). We need to count islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
```cpp
Example-1
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1               //Only 1 island

Example-2
Input: grid = [       
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3               //3 islands
```

== Approach-1, Find link:/DS_Questions/Data_Structures/Graphs#t[Connected Components]. DFS
=== Logic-1
1. Take visited[][] vector same sized as original 2D vector.
2. Mark all adjacent `1's` as visited using recursion. Do not use queue/stack because it will slow adding and removing elements to queue.
3. Traverse whole array and check unvisited `1's`: count++ whenever unvisited 1 is found.
```cpp
using vecVecC = vector<vector<char>>;
using vecI = vector<int>;
using vecVecI = vector<vecI>;

class Solution {
public:
  void markConnectedVisited(vecVecC& grid, vecVecI& vis, int f, int s, int row, int col){
    vis[f][s]=1;
    if (f>0 && (vis[f-1][s] == false) && (grid[f-1][s] == '1')){        //Above Element
      markConnectedVisited (grid, vis, f-1, s, row, col);
     }
    if (s>0 && (vis[f][s-1] == false) &&  (grid[f][s-1] == '1')){       //Left Element
      markConnectedVisited (grid, vis, f, s-1, row, col);
    }
    if ((s<=col-2) && (vis[f][s+1] == false) && (grid[f][s+1] == '1')){ //Right Element
      markConnectedVisited (grid, vis, f, s+1, row, col);
    }
    if ((f<=row-2) && (vis[f+1][s] == false) && (grid[f+1][s] == '1')){ //Below element
      markConnectedVisited (grid, vis, f+1, s, row, col);
    }
  }

  int numIslands(vecVecC& grid){
    int rows = grid.size(), cols=grid[0].size(), count = 0;
    if(rows == 0)
        return 0;

    vecVecI vis(rows, vecI(cols,0)); //Visited Array of same size as grid, init to 0

    for(int i=0; i<rows; i++)                              //O(mn)
      for(int j=0; j<cols; j++)
                        
        if(vis[i][j]==0 && grid[i][j]=='1'){
          count++;
          markConnectedVisited (grid, vis, i, j, rows, cols);
        }
     return count;
   }
};
```


=== Logic-2 (Modify input array)
1. Each visited node is marked as 2
2. Start from index=0,0. Mark Island as 2.
```cpp
   1  1  1  1  0      2 2 2 2 0
   1  1  0  1  0      2 2 0 2 0
   1  1  0  0  0      2 2 0 0 0 
   0  0  0  0  0      0 0 0 0 0
```
=== Complexity
* Time: O(mxn). m=rows, n=cols
* Space: O(1)

    // Return true if any 1 is found in 4 directions
    bool checkAllDirections(int row, int col, vector<vector<char>>& grid){

            return false;

    }

            int r = row+rowDirections[i];
            int c = col+colDirections[i];
            if (checkAllDirections(r, c, grid)) {
                searchNeighbours (r, c, grid);
            }            
        }
    }
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        int count = 0;
        rows = grid.size();
        cols = grid[0].size();

                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    count += 1;
                    searchNeighbours (i, j, grid);
                }
            }
