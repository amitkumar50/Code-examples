You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.
```c
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

Example 2:
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```

=== Approach-1. Space:O(n). Time:O(n). Hashmap
==== Logic
* 1. Store char from t and number of time of its occurance in HashMap
```c
t = "abcdea"
HashMap:  |a,2|b,1|c,1|d,1|e,1|
```
* 2. Traverse `s`, if char found, reduce count from HashMap. if count reaches 0, remove from HashMap
* 3. HashMap will contain only 1 entry ie the extra character.

==== Complexity
==== Code
===== CPP98
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        // Fill t in Hashset
        unordered_map<char, int> um;
        for (const auto&i:t)
            um[i]++;
        
        // Find every char in set, if not found return that
        for (const auto&i:s){
            auto it = um.find(i);
            if (it == um.end())
                return i;
            else {
                um[i]--;
                if (um[i] == 0)
                    um.erase(it);
            }
        }
        char out;
        for (auto&i:um)
            out = i.first;
        return out;
    }
};
