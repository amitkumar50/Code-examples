- **Why Twisting is done?** 
  - Waves from different twists cancel out, so radiations are less.
  - Signal = difference in voltage between the two wires in pair. This provides better immunity to external noise because the noise affects both wires the same, leaving the differential unchanged.
- **Analog or Digital?** Twisted pairs can transmit either analog or digital information. 
- **Bandwidth?** Depends on thickness of the wire and the distance traveled. 5-10MB/sec for 2-3kms.
- **Advantage?** Low cost
