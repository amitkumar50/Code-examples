## Module
- **What?** Same as [python module](/Languages/ScriptingLanguages/Python/Modules). File containing functions, class, variables etc. Modules can be used side-by-side of header files, see difference below.
- **Why?** Modules help divide large amounts of code into logical parts.

### Modules vs Header Files
| | Modules | Headers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| include | import modules in any order without concern for macro redefinitions | provide header guards so that its not included again |
