== SWG (secure web gateway)?
* SWG is network security solution that helps organizations protect: 
1. Their users and data from web-based threats(internet-borne viruses, malware)
2. Enforce security policies for internet usage.

== 1. Requirements
=== Functional
[[req1]]
* 1. *URL Filtering:* Some URLs are marked as filtered and policies are enforced on their access.

[[req2]]
* 2. *Web Traffic Filtering:* Inspect/filter web traffic in real-time, allow/block access to websites based on predefined security policies.

[[req3]]
* 3. *Malware and Threat Protection:* Scan & block web content for malware, viruses, and other malicious code.

[[req4]]
* 4. *Data Loss Prevention (DLP):* Enforce DLP policies to prevent sensitive data from being leaked or shared.

[[req5]]
* 5. *SSL/TLS Inspection:* SWGs can decrypt and inspect encrypted web traffic to detect threats hidden within encrypted connections. This is crucial as many threats now use encryption to evade detection.

[[req6]]
* 6. *User Authentication:* Integrate with identity and access management systems to enforce security policies based on user roles and permissions.

[[req7]]
* 7. *Reporting and Analytics:* Generate reports and provide insights into web usage patterns and security incidents.

[[req8]]
* 8. *Cloud-Based or On-Premises:* Can be deployed in the cloud/on-premises, or as hybrid solution, depending on an organization's requirements and preferences.

[[req9]]
* 9. *Mobile Device Support:* Protect mobile devices, ensuring that users are secured even when they access the internet from smartphones and tablets.
