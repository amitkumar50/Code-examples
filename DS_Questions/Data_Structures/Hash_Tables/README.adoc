== Hash Table
* Data structure that associates keys with values. `<key, value>`, Supports constant time lookups. Average Case: O(1), Worst case: O(n)
* *Hash Function?* Hash function maps a big number or string to a small integer that can be used as index in hash table.
```c
key -> |Hash Function| -> index of array/table
```

[[dat]]
=== Hash Table is improvement over Direct Access Table
* *DAT?* Take huge array and use phone numbers as index in the array. if phone number is not present entry is empty, else the array entry stores pointer to records corresponding to phone number. Searching in DA: O(1) but HUGE Extra Space required.

=== Advantage
Search in O(1) time.

=== Disadvantages
* *a. Guess Approximate input data:* We have to know approximate size of input data before initializing hash table. Once all HT entries are filled it needs resized/rehashing which is a time-consuming operation. Eg:
** Let HT size = 100, we want to  insert 101st element. Not only the size of hash table is enlarged to 150, all element in hash table have to be rehashed. This insertion operation takes O(n).
** *b. Elements are stored as unsorted order:* Some circumstance data should stored in sorted order. Eg: contacts in cell phone.
** *c. Hash Collision:* When hash function provides same index/value for 2 different keys.
```c
  key -> |Hash Function| -> index of array/table
```

== HT vs Self Balanced BT
```c
                                                         Hash-Tables            |        Self-Balancing BT
---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------
Complexity(Insert/Delete/Search) | O(1)[Average Time], O(n) during table resize | O(log n)[guaranteed all times].
Collision                        | Yes                                          | never
Implementation                   | Tough, We depend on libraries                | Easy, we can implement our own customized BST
ADVANTAGES of Tree over HT       |                                              | 1. Data can be retrieved in sorted order. inorder-traversal: O(n)
                                                                                | 2. lowest, biggest element finding: easy
                                                                                | 3. No need to guess size of input data.
```

== HT Internal Implementation
* It can be implemented in several different ways
=== Implementation-1 (Array of linked lists)
image::images/ht_implementation_array_of_linked_lists.jpg?raw=true[ht_implementation_array_of_linked_lists]

```c
int Hash_Function(string key, int arr_len) {
  convert key to ascii
  return key % arr_len
}
 
int index = Hash_Function("hi", 4);   //ascii_of_hi=104105,index=1

  insert(key=hi, value=34)
    hi > |Hash_Function| > 1
    -> Move to index=1 and store (key=hi,value=34) into linked list

  search(key=hi)
    key > |Hash_Function| > 1
    -> Reach index=1 and search key.
```

=== Implementation-2 (Array of BST)
* In place of plain linked list, we can use BST making searching O(logn) complexity.

== Hash Collision
When hash function provides same index for 2 different keys.

=== Solution-1: Seperate Chaining
* Each cell of HT point to a **DOUBLY LINKED LIST** of records that have same hash function value. This requires additional memory outside the table.
* *Complexities:*
** Insert(x): O(1). Insert at head of LL
** Search(x): O(n). Need to search complete list
** Delete(x): O(1). Assumed we are at element in chain, we delete x. copy prev to next pointer. In singly LL we need O(n) time to search prev node.
* *Advantages:* Simple implementation, Space will never exhaust, Less sensitive to hash function
* *Disadvantages:*
** Once LL/chain grows long, performance will degrade search time=O(n)
** Space wastage, some parts of hash table may never be used
** Devotes huge amount of memory to pointers. This is space that could be used to make the table larger
* *Load Factor Î± = n/m* where m=slots, n=elements

```c
  Example:  Hash Function = xmod7, a[]={50, 700, 76, 85, 46, 92, 73, 10}        
  50mod7=1, 700mod7=0,  76mod7=6,  85mod7=1,    46mod7=1
                     46
                     |
                    85
                     |
        |  700  |   50     |        |        |        |        |    76    |        Hash Table
             0         1          2      3       4        5       6
```
=== Solution-2: Open Addressing  
All elements are stored in HT itself. Once same hash is derived, insert element in hash table itself no seperate chains.

image::https://i.ibb.co/b7Qnkh2/oa.png?raw=true[Open Addressing]

==== Types of Open addressing
* *1. Linear/Sequential probing*
** *INSERTION*: Once same hash is derived, inserts the new item in the next open spot in the table ie next to already existent element with same hash. If the table is not too full, the contiguous runs of items should be fairly small, hence this location should be only a few slots from its intended position
** *DELETION:* Ugly here removing one element might break a chain of insertions, making some elements inaccessible. We need to reinsert all the items into new holes.
  
* *2. Quadratic Probing*
look for i<sup>2</sup>th slot in i'th iteration. New hash function = (xmod7 + i2)%hash_table_size
```c
  h0 = (xmod7 + 0*0)%hash_table_size
  h1 = (xmod7 + 1*1)%hash_table_size
  h1 = (xmod7 + 2*2)%hash_table_size
  Example: Hash Function = xmod11  a[]=7,36,18,62.   7mod11=7,  36mod11=3,  18mod11=7,  62mod11=7
    Insert: Collision at insertion of 18. Since collision had occurred, we calculate h1 = (18mod11 + 1*1 = 8)
    Collision at insertion of 62. Since collision had occurred, we calculate h1 = (18mod11 + 1*1 = 8) which is occupied.  We calculate h2= (62mod11+ 2*2 = 11). This goes to index 0. And we insert.
    |   62   |        |        |   36  |        |        |        |    7     |   18     |        |        |
        0        1       2       3        4          5       6         7          8        9        10
```

* *3. DOUBLE HASHING:* We use double hash function to re-calculate the hash if collision occurs.  In case of collision: hash1(x) = (hash1(x) + i*hash2(x))%hash_table_size
** Comparison
```
                          Advantages                                     Disadvantages
Linear Probing      Easy to implement, best cache performance        Suffers from clustering
Quadratic Probing   Avg cache performance                            Small clustering occurs
Double hashing      worst cache performance                          No clustering occurs, More computation time is required.
```

== Rehashing
Let's consider `unordered_map<int,string>` storing unique keys. At start of program sizeof hash table=3
```c
  Key | Value
  ----------
  01  | amit
  02  | never
  03  | give
```
* Now, (4, up) need to be stored, but hash table has no space so size of hash table is increased to 6. 
* (old Hash function = %3) we can only goto index number=2. But we want to reach 5. Hence Hash function is changed (old Hash function = %6). So hash is again calculated for existing values.

== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashmap/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-10-04[Leetcode Question. 706. Design HashMap]
Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.

Implement the MyHashMap class:

MyHashMap() initializes the object with an empty map.
void put(int key, int value) inserts a (key, value) pair into the HashMap. If the key already exists in the map, update the corresponding value.
int get(int key) returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or -1 if this map contains no mapping for the key.
void remove(key) removes the key and its corresponding value if the map contains the mapping for the key.
```c
Example 1:

Input
["MyHashMap", "put", "put", "get", "get", "put", "get", "remove", "get"]
[[], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3], [2, 1], [2], [2], [2]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, -1, null, 1, null, -1]

Explanation
MyHashMap myHashMap = new MyHashMap();
myHashMap.put(1, 1); // The map is now [[1,1]]
myHashMap.put(2, 2); // The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.get(1);    // return 1, The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.get(3);    // return -1 (i.e., not found), The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.put(2, 1); // The map is now [[1,1], [2,1]] (i.e., update the existing value)
myHashMap.get(2);    // return 1, The map is now [[1,1], [2,1]]
myHashMap.remove(2); // remove the mapping for 2, The map is now [[1,1]]
myHashMap.get(2);    // return -1 (i.e., not found), The map is now [[1,1]]
```

=== <<dat, Approach-1. Direct Access Table>>
* Create a array of size=100001. Store hash_table[key] = value

==== Code
===== CPP
```cpp
class MyHashMap {
    array<int, 1000001> ar1;
public:
    MyHashMap() {
        ar1.fill(-1);
    }    
    void put(int key, int value) {
        ar1[key] = value;
    }
    int get(int key) {
        return ar1[key];
    }
    void remove(int key) {
        ar1[key] = -1;
    }
};

/**
 * Your MyHashMap object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyHashMap* obj = new MyHashMap();
 * obj->put(key,value);
 * int param_2 = obj->get(key);
 * obj->remove(key);
 */
```

=== Approach-2. Resizable HashTable. O(1)
==== Logic
1. Hash table will be vector<vector<pair<int,int>>. This will store same keyed value in chain format.
```c
|                                   |                                    |
| {<key=1,val=2>, <key=100,val=10>} | {<key=13,val=3>, <key=130,val=8>}  |
|                                   |                                    |
      key=hash_from_fun
```
2. Start with Hash table size=19997
3. Hash Function. mult and size are prime numbers in hope that we get unique indexes for unique keys most of times.
```c
hash = index_in_array = (key * mult) % size;
```
4. put(key, value)
```c
a. Find hash of key, ie index in hasharray
b. traverse in internal vector, to find we have matching key. once key is found insert into value, if key is not found insert new entry into hash array
```
5. count number of keys hasharray, if keys > present size of hash array. resize the hasharray and REHASH all existing keys

==== Complexity
* *Time:* 
** Search: number of hash collisions
** Insert: number of hash collisions
* *Space:* number of unique keys

==== Code
===== CPP
```cpp
class MyHashMap {
    int numKeys;
                        //key, value
    using pII = std::pair<int, int>;
    using vP = std::vector<pII>;    //vector<pair>
    using vvP = std::vector<vP>;    //vector<vector<pair>>
public:

    // Taking size, mult as Big prime numbers
    // in hope we will have even distribution
    // of entries in hashmap array
    const static int size = 19997;
    const static int mult = 12582917;

    vvP data;

    MyHashMap() :numKeys(0) {
        // Start with small hashmap, resize
        // as more keys come in
        data.resize(size);
    }

    int hash(int key) {
        return (int)((long)key * mult % size);
    }

    void put(int key, int val) {
        remove(key);
        int index = hash(key);
        data[index].emplace_back(key, val);

        // Keep track of keys in hashmap array
        numKeys++;

        // Check if it's time to resize the table
        if (numKeys >= data.size() / 2) {
            rehash(data.size() * 2);
        }
    }

    int get(int key) {
        int index = hash(key);
        for (const auto& entry : data[index]) {
            if (entry.first == key)
                return entry.second;
        }
        return -1;
    }

    void remove(int key) {
        int index = hash(key);
        auto& bucket = data[index];
        for (auto it = bucket.begin(); it != bucket.end(); ++it) {
            if (it->first == key) {
                bucket.erase(it);
                numKeys--;
                return;
            }
        }
    }

    // Resize the hash table and rehash existing elements
    void rehash(size_t newTableSize) {
        vvP newData(newTableSize);
        for (const auto& bucket : data) {
            for (const auto& entry : bucket) {
                size_t newIndex = entry.first % newTableSize;
                newData[newIndex].emplace_back(entry);
            }
        }
        data.swap(newData);
    }
};
