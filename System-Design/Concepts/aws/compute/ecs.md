## ECS(Elastic Container Service)
  - **What**
    - This is container management service that makes it easy to run/stop/manage Docker containers on a cluster.
    - This one of the most used services today.
    - After a cluster is up and running, you can define task definitions and services that specify which Docker container images to run 
    across your clusters.
  - **AWS Fargate**
    - This is an easy way to deploy your containers on AWS.
    - Fargate is like EC2 but instead of giving you a virtual machine you get a container.
