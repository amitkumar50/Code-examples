## Encryption / Cryptography / Confidentiality
- **What?** Conversion of Data/Plain-text into unreadable/cipher text.

### Cipher Algorithms
  - **1. Substitution Cipher:** each letter or group of letters is replaced by another letter or group of letters. Eg: Caesar ciphers(b becomes E, c becomes F)
  - **2. Block Ciphers(Mostly used):** Encrypt block of characters        
  - **3. Stream Ciphers(Obsolete):** Encrypt Single character at a time
