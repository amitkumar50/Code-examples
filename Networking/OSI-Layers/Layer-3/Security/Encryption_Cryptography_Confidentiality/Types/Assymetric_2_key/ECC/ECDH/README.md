## Ecliptic Curve based DH(Diffie Hellman)
- Allows two parties, each having an elliptic-curve publicâ€“private key pair, to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. 
- This shared secret maybe used directly as key or derive another key. 
- The key, or the derived key, can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric-key cipher.
