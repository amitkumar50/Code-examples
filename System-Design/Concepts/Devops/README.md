## Dev(developer), Ops(Operations or deployment)
- **How Metrics are measured**
  - **Dev teams** Amount of new changes they can deliver. This builds their reputation.
  - **Opeerations team** How stable software is in production.
    - But dont you think these are OPPOSITE. So, what happens? Dev team continually creates new features/changes/bug fixes and throws them over the wall to operations. The operations team perfects its best defense to prevent change.

## Traditional development model(SDLC)
### Problems?
1. Code Broke in Production!!
   - Dev(4 moths) --> testing(2 months) --> Production(Code Broke)**Why?** 
     - Because code bases running on prod and dev were hugely different. it might be no one's fault
     - Different tools, management models used by development-team and operations-team.

### Solution(Devops) 
#### What is Devops?
- Close these gaps by aligning approaches, tools.
- Bringing Agile approaches to all parts of the software delivery process.
- streaming feedback from production to development and improving the cycle time. (i.e., the time from inception to delivery)
- **Success of Devops** is in culture of trust b/w different depts, culture of sharing ideas, issues, processes, tools, and goals.
  - Development: Programmers do not code alone; rather, everyone helps them to understand what to code
  - Quality: Testers are not solely responsible for quality; rather, the whole team works together to maintain quality.
#### Why Devops?
1. Deliver High quality software more quickly, which is more aligned with customer's requirements and basic conditions.

- CI(Cont Integration)/CD(Cont Delivery): gitlab
