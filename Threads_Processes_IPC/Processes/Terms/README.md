## Terms
- **[Atomic Operation(Uninterrupted Operation)](Atomic_Operation.md)
- **Bound Waiting:** Process-2 waits outside critical section while process-1 is executing inside.
- **Critical Section(requires Mutual Exclusion):** 
  - Piece of code where 2 processes/threads are not allowed to execute concurrently. 
  - Ex: shared data structures, peripheral device, or network connection. CS should be accessed using synchronization. Eg: semaphore
- **Pareto Principle:** 90% of CPU cycles are spent in 10% of code. Means we have to focus & parallelly implement this 10% of code
