## S3
- This service stores data(eg: images, videos, text files) using objects. Amazon S3 stores data as objects in buckets.
- The maximum file size for an object in Amazon S3 is 5 TB.

### Features/Advantages
- **1. Web Enabled:** Every Object has a URL from where it can be downloaded/seen.
- **2. Regionally Avaialble:** Highly Durable. 99.999999999% {11 9's}
- **3. [Serverless:](/System-Design/Concepts/AWS/compute/Lambda):** No EC2 instances are needed.
- **4. Support Cross Region Replication:**
  - You designate a destination S3 bucket in another Region.
  - When Cross-Region Replication is turned on, any new object that is uploaded will be replicated to the destination S3 bucket
- **5. S3 Transfer Acceleration (have additional chaarges):**
  - A bucket-level feature for fast,secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket.
  - it uses globally distributed [edge locations](/System-Design/Concepts/AWS/Terms#el) to transfer data.
  - As data arrives at an edge location, the data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.
- **6. AWS Macie:** This is data security and data privacy service that uses ML to help identify & protect sensitive data in S3 buckets. Eg:
  - Macie can detect personal information eg: names, password, credit card information etc
- **7. Autoscaling:** S3 and DynamoDB automatically scale as demand dictates

### S3 storage classes
- Factors when choosing a storage class: How often data need to retrieved, How available data need to be?
- _Charges at Glacier:_ 1. For storage per GB/month basis. 2. Retrieval requests

|Storage class|Designed for|Number of AZ in which data is stored|Cost|Charged at time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1. Standard|Frequently accessed data|3|Costliest|Data Exgress,GB/month storage|
|2. Standard-IA(Infrequent Access)|Infrequent accessed and highly avaialble data|3|Cheaper than Standard|Data Exgress,Per object|
|3. One Zone-IA||1||Data Exgress,Per object|
|4. Intelligent-Tiering|For data which is accessed randomly||||
|5. Glacier|Data archiving|Able to retrieve objects from 1min-1Hours|Low|Data Exgress,|
|6. Glacier Deep Archive||Able to retrieve objects within 12 hours|Lowest|Data Exgress,|

### Creating S3 Bucket
```c
AWS Console > s3
  Bucket name:                amit-bucket       //This should be globally unique
  Upload files to bucket:     Upload (Upload files from desktop)
                              We can download files from bucket as well.
```
