## 8086
> 8086 has 20 bit Address bus, 16 bit data bus.
  - *AD0 - AD15:* Multiplexed address and data bus. At a time either address or data will be transmitted by the bus.
  - *A16 - A19:* 4 is multiplexed with status signal. 
  - *S4, S3:* Shows which segment is processed by microprocessor.
```html
  S4  S3  Function
  0   0   Extra segment(Heap)
  0   1   Stack
  1   0   code
  1   1   Data
```
  - *S5(interrupt flag):* shows the presence of an interrupts in the microprocessor.
  - *BHE(Bus High Enable):* BHE signal and S7 status informs about the existence of the data on the bus.
  - *CLK?* Clock input must have a duty cycle of 33% (high for 1/3 and low for 2/3s)
  - *VCC/GND?* Power supply (5V) and GND (0V). 
  - *INTR(interrupt request):* High on this pin indicates presence of interrupt
  - *INTA(Interrupt Acknowledge):* Generated by the microprocessor in response to INTR. Causes the interrupt vector to be put onto the data bus.
  - *NMI(Non-maskable interrupt):* Similar to INTR, this interrupt cannot be ignored need to be processed.
