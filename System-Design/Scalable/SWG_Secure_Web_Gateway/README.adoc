== SWG (secure web gateway)?
* SWG is network security solution that helps organizations protect: 
1. Their users and data from web-based threats(internet-borne viruses, malware)
2. Enforce security policies for internet usage.

== 1. Requirements
=== Functional
[[req1]]
* 1. *Centralized Control:* Using SWG cloud perform centralized control and management of web traffic filtering policies.

[[req2]]
* 2. *URL Filtering:* Some URLs are marked as filtered and policies are enforced on their access.

[[req3]]
* 3. *Web Traffic Filtering:* Inspect/filter web traffic in real-time, allow/block access to websites based on predefined security policies.

[[req4]]
* 4. *Malware and Threat Protection:* Scan & block web content for malware, viruses, and other malicious code.

[[req5]]
* 5. *Data Loss Prevention (DLP):* Enforce DLP policies to prevent sensitive data from being leaked or shared.

[[req6]]
* 6. *SSL/TLS Inspection:* SWGs can decrypt and inspect encrypted web traffic to detect threats hidden within encrypted connections. This is crucial as many threats now use encryption to evade detection.

[[req7]]
* 7. *User Authentication:* Integrate with identity and access management systems to enforce security policies based on user roles and permissions.

[[req8]]
* 8. *Reporting and Analytics:* Generate reports and provide insights into web usage patterns and security incidents.

[[req9]]
* 9. *Cloud-Based or On-Premises:* Can be deployed in the cloud/on-premises, or as hybrid solution, depending on an organization's requirements and preferences.

[[req10]]
* 10. *Mobile Device Support:* Protect mobile devices, ensuring that users are secured even when they access the internet from smartphones and tablets.

=== Non-Functional
Scalable, Reliable

== 3. API Design

== 4. DB Schema

== 5. HLD
=== <<req1, 1. Centralized Control>>
* Send all traffic to SWG cloud, this makes easier for organizations to enforce consistent web access policies across all users and devices.

==== Types of Users
* *1. Roaming User*
** Roaming means user(HCL Employee) not connected to company VPN, sitting in airport coffee shop & want to browse internet.
** He Opens `google.com`, browser redirects him to *POP(Poing of presense)*. POP forwards to *Celo(Central Lokation)* which does all monitoring.
* *2. Branch office(on prem) users*

==== Methods of sending traffic to SWG
===== link:https://github.com/amitkumar50/pvt-research/blob/master/Projects/Juniper/FS/README.adoc[1. ON-PREM=Branch Office Customers. GRE/IPSec Tunnel]
** No IPSec negotation and encryption. Since webtraffic is already encrypted GRE encryption not needed.
** Every user has pvt IP(ie all traffic comes without link:/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer-3/Routing/NAT[NAT] to identify the user.
** *Problems:* 1. User wants higher throughput? Configure more tunnels at CPE router, because tunnels may be exhausted.

* 

== Terms
=== Service Location (Tenant Specific)
* SL is created in UI (for tenant=customer). When SL is created on pre-created POP, n number of firewall instances(vsrx) are created to serve users for tenant.
* SL is identified by (tenantid + POPid).
