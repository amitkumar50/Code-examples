## Types of Graphs
- **Cyclic/Acyclic:**
  - *Cyclic:* If graph has cycle.  
  - *Acyclic:* No cycles in graph. When following the graph from node to node, you will never visit the same node twice.
    - **[DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph)](DAG)**
- **[Directionality](Directed_Undirected):** Directed, Undirected    
- **[Spanning Tree](Spanning_Tree)**    
- *Weighted, Unweighted Graph:*
  - *Weighted?* If edges has cost/weight. Ex: flight fuel cost between cities.        
  - *Unweighted?* if the edges do not have weights.
