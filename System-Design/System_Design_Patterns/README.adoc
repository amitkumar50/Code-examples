=== System Design Architectural Patterns
|===
| Pattern Name | Detials | Diag

|1.Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) (Synchronous Event Driven)
a|
* User -command-> Thread-1(Command center) -write-> DB
* DB -read-> Thread-2(Read service)
* *Adv:* less complex
| 

|2. Two-Phase Commit (2PC) (Synchronous Event Driven)
a|
* (Prepare Phase). Coordinator tells service to prepare data
* (Commit Phase). Coordinator tells service to send data
* *Adv:* Consistent, Resistant to error
** Ech service is unlocked 1 byt 1 to send data
| 

|3. Saga (eg: AWS) (Asynchronous Event Driven)
a|
* services communicate using Bus/Queue
* *Adv:* Longer transactions can be handled
| 

|4. Replicated Load-Balanced Services (RLBS)
a|
* Duplicate services sit behind load balancer
* *Adv:* Consistent performance, Quick recoverly
| 

|5. Sharded Services (Asynchronous)
a|
* Multiple services, each completing specific task
* *Adv:* Simple to debug
| 

|6. Side car
a|
* Extend primary container functionality by attaching an auxiliary container(called sidecar)
* Provides support functionalities, such as logging, monitoring, service discovery, security etc
* *Adv:* Modularity and Extensibility
