=== Cache
==== What data should be cached?
- Mostly used, less frequently changing data is stored in cache. (Eg: Metadata, configuration data, Historical data sets for reports)
- Cache lies near to requester so that requester need not to go hard-disk to retrieve data. This reduces latency.
- **What should not be cached?** Data that is frequently/actively changing.
```c
App/Webserver <--->[Cache]<-->[Database]
```
- **Examples?** Web browser, Web proxy, Application server, Web server caches, CDN
- **Stores:** User sessions, user profile, some historical data.
 
=== Types of Caches
|===
| Method | What | Disadvantage | Advantage

|1. Write Thru Cache|Data written to cache and DB both|Latency is high|2 copies stored
|2. Write Around Cache|Write goes directly to DB. Operation is considered completed only after writing to DB|Reading recent data is  cache miss & need to be read from DB. High latency|Cache flooding avoided
|3. Write Back Cache|Write done to cache only. Cache writes the info to DB(asynchronously).|Data availability risk(cache may fail)|Low latency, High throughput

==== 2. Web Browser Cache
* *What?* Browser stores local copies of web resources for faster retrieval the next time the resource is required.
** Eg: Once browser downloads CSS, JS files, images (for a session) there is no need again to download from same server and can be cached.

* *CACHE-CONTROL HEADER* HTTP server instructs browser(http client) to cache a particular content for TTL duration in cache control header. Format: Response Header {cache-control: public, max-age: 45223}

==== 3. Web Proxy Cache
* *1.* Web client asks content from Web-server. Request reaches Web proxy. Web proxy checks its cache, if content available serves it
* *2.* If content is not available Web Proxy checks from other web proxies over **high-speed** link.

===== 1. Memcached 
* This is  Distributed Hash-Table ie <key,value> across multiple nodes. Implemented as LRU.
* Sits on separate machine b/w Application server and DB. Multiple servers work in conjunction to act as single larger logical data cache. 
 * *Stores* User sessions, User profile, some historical data etc.
```c
          WebServer   App-server/DB-Client     DB-frontEnd          MEMCACHED         DB
                                  ---query table1--->    ---table1---->
                                                         <--NULL------
                                                  --------query table1------------>
                                                <-table1-    table1|expiry-time ------
```
