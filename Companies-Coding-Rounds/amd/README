INTEL VS AMD?
                 INTEL         AMD
Market-share      80%
recent CPU size   14 nanomtr    7 nanomtr  //AMD won many customer orders. AMD launched this in feb/2020
Gaming Processor  i7,i9        ryzen(7 nm) //ryzen Performs better
                has 8 cores    has 12 cores //more cores better it is
                same price     same price
