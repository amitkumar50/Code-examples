=== Cache
==== What data should be cached?
- Mostly used, less frequently changing data is stored in cache. (Eg: Metadata, configuration data, Historical data sets for reports)
- Cache lies near to requester so that requester need not to go hard-disk to retrieve data. This reduces latency.
- **What should not be cached?** Data that is frequently/actively changing.
```c
App/Webserver <--->[Cache]<-->[Database]
```
- **Examples?** Web browser, Web proxy, Application server, Web server caches, CDN
- **Stores:** User sessions, user profile, some historical data.
 
=== Types of Caches
|===
| Method | What | Disadvantage | Advantage

|1. Write Thru Cache|Data written to cache and DB both|Latency is high|2 copies stored
|2. Write Around Cache|Write goes directly to DB. Operation is considered completed only after writing to DB|Reading recent data is  cache miss & need to be read from DB. High latency|Cache flooding avoided
|3. Write Back Cache|Write done to cache only. Cache writes the info to DB(asynchronously).|Data availability risk(cache may fail)|Low latency, High throughput
