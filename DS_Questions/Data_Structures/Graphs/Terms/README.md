  ## Terms
  - **Cyclic/Acyclic?** 
    - *Cyclic:* If graph has cycle.  
    - *Acyclic:* No cycles in graph. When following the graph from node to node, you will never visit the same node twice.
      - **[DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph)](DAG)**
  - **[Directionality](Directed_Undirected):** Directed, Undirected
  - **Edge/Arc/Line?** Links connecting the nodes. Links can be directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted. Weight also means cost.
  - **[Spanning Tree](Spanning_Tree)**
  - **[Topological Sorting](Topological_Sorting)**
  - **Vertex/Node?** Interconnected objects are called vertices.
  - **Weighted, Unweighted Graph?** 
    - *Weighted?* If edges has cost/weight. Ex: flight fuel cost between cities.        
    - *Unweighted?* if the edges do not have weights.
