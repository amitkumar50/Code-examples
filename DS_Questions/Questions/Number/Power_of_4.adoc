Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of four. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of four, if there exists an integer x such that n == 4x.
```
Example 1:
Input: n = 16
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: n = 5
Output: false
```

== Approach-1. Divide
=== Logic
* Divide number by 4, if reminder=0, number=number/4
* perform above steps until number of reduced to number less than 4
* if final number got is 1, number of power of 4 else not

=== Code
==== Python
```py
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfFour(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n == 0:
            return False
        if n==1:
            return True
        
        while n%4 == 0:
            n = n//4
        if n==1:
            return True
        return False
```

== Approach-2. Bitwise. Check on bits of number. O(logn)
=== Logic
* 1. Number is power of 4 if following 2 conditions are satisfied:
** a. Number has only 1 bit set
** b. count of off bits before on bits is even

=== Code
==== Python
```py
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfFour(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n == 0 or n == 2 or n == 3:
            return False
        if n==1:
            return True

        count = 0
        # Number is power of 4 if 
        # a. only 1 bit is set
        # b. number of off bits before on are even

        #Check if there is only one bit set in n
        if n&n-1 == 0:
            #number of off bits before on are even
            while n > 1:
                n >>= 1
                count += 1
            if count%2 == 0:
                return True
            else:
                return False
 
        return False
```

== Approach-3. Checking Bits of number. O(1)
== Logic
* Number is power of 4 if below 2 conditions are met
```c
a. only 1 bit is set
and
b. number & 0xAAAA = 0. (this means count of off bits before on bits is even or there is no ON bit at odd place)
0xAAAA = 1010 1010 1010 1010
```

== Code
=== Python
```py
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfFour(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n == 0 or n == 2 or n == 3:
            return False
        if n==1:
            return True

        count = 0
        """
        Number is power of 4 if below 2 conditions are met
        a. only 1 bit is set
        and
        b. number & 0xAAAA = 0. (this means count of off bits before on bits is even or there is no ON bit at odd place)
        0xAAAA = 1010 1010 1010 1010
        """

        #Check if there is only one bit set in n
        if n&n-1 == 0:
            #number of off bits before on are even
            if n & 0xAAAAAAAA == 0:
                return True
 
        return False
```

=== Javascript
```js
var isPowerOfFour = function(n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 2 || n == 3) {
      return false;
    }
    if (n == 1) {
        return true;
    }
    
    if ((n & (n - 1)) === 0) {
      if ((n & 0xAAAAAAAA) === 0) {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
};
```
