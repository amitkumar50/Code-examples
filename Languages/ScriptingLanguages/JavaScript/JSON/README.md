## JSON / JavaScript Object Notation
- Invented by "Douglas Crockford".
- JSON is text-based, language-independent **data interchange format**. JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects.
- **JSON Comments:** There are no comments in a JSON document. Reasons:
  - JSON parsers had difficulties supporting comments.
  - People were abusing comments. For example, Comments were being used for parsing directives, which would have destroyed interoperability.
  - Removing comments simplified and enabled cross-platform JSON support.

## 2. Why JSON
- *1.* [RESTful Web Applications](/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer5/WebServer_to_WebClient_Connection_Methods/REST) can communicate using JSON.
- *2.* The simplicity of JSONâ€™s basic data structures
- *3.* The increasing popularity of JavaScript
- *4.* Thousands of RESTful APIs leverage JSON. Eg: LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Salesforce, GitHub, DropBox, Tumblr, Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## 3. JSON datatypes
### Core Data Types
- **1. Name (or Key)/value pair:** Consists of a key and a value.
  - Valid value types: Object, array, string, number, boolean, null
```json
nameValue.json {
 "name": "amit",                  //Value type: String
 "age": 36,                       //Value type: int
}
```
- **2. Object:** An unordered collection of name/value pairs.
```json
Object.json {
 "address" : {
   "Flat no": "B602"
   "city"   : "Mountain View",
   "country": "USA"
  }
}
```
- **3. Array:** Contains nested objects. Array is enclosed using `[ ]`.
```json
Array.json {
  "People": [            //Array         
    {
      "name": "Amit",
      "age" : 36,
    },
    {
      "name": "Ram",
      "age" : 10,
    }
  ]
}
```
