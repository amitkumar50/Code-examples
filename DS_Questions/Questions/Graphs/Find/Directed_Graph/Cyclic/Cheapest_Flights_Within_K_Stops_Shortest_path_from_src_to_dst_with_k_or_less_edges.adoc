== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/[787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops]
There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.

You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.

Example 1:
image:https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/18/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops-3drawio.png?raw=true[ex1]
```c
Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
Output: 700
Explanation:
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.
```

== Approach-1. Single Source Shortest Path. Dijkstra Algo
=== Logic
- Similar to Dijstra's Shortest path Algo we will take `minHeap<cost,node,stops>`
- Fill neighbours, increase stops by 1.
- When (stops > K) continue;    //ie if any node is reachable with stops > k, then its no use to consider it.

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
using VecI = vector<int>;
using VecVecI = vector<VecI>;
using UsI = unordered_set<int>;

                //cost_to_reach_this_node, node, stops_to_reach_this_Node
using tple = tuple<int, int, int>;

class Solution {
    //priority_queue <mpair, vector<mpair>, greater<mpair>> minHeap;
    priority_queue <tple, vector<tple>, greater<tple>> minHeap;
    unordered_map<int/*src*/, unordered_map<int/*dst*/, int/*cost*/>> graph;

    void create_weighted_graph(int cities, VecVecI& flights) {
        for (int i=0;i<flights.size();++i) {
            int src = flights[i][0];
            int dst = flights[i][1];
            int cost = flights[i][2];
            graph[src].insert(make_pair(dst,cost));
        }
    }

public:
    int findCheapestPrice(int n, VecVecI& flights, int start, int dst, int K) {

        //Create a Adjacency List
        create_weighted_graph(n, flights);
        
        vector<int> cost_from_start_node(n+1, INT_MAX);

        //Cost of reaching start node=0 is 0 with stops=0
        minHeap.emplace(0, start, 0);

        while( !minHeap.empty() ) {
            auto [cost, node, stop] = minHeap.top(); minHeap.pop();

            if( node == dst )
                return cost;

                //Optimization to avoid TLE
            if(cost_from_start_node[node] < stop)
                continue;

            cost_from_start_node[node] = stop;

            if(stop >K ) 
                continue;
            
            for( auto it : graph[node] ) {
                auto [neighbour, cost_to_reach_neighbour] = it;
                minHeap.emplace(cost+cost_to_reach_neighbour,
                                neighbour,
                                stop+1);
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
