## Quality
- **What** 
  - Behavior of the software in production and the cycle time.
  -  Quality canâ€™t be injected into the application post mortem.
- **Quality Types**
  - *a. Internal Quality* This is quality of the design and code.
    -  if internal quality is poor, the external quality will also suffer because application will raise an increasing number of bugs.
  - *b. External Quality* This is measured by what you see while using the application.
- **How to improve Quality**
  - Quality code & design & Improve constantly and forever the system of production.
  - Break down barriers between departments.
  - Pass all automated tests, continuous delivery(delivery pipeline, from development to production).
