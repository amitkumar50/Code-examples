## Terms
- **RNA(Ribonucleic acid)?** This is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes.
- **Polymeric?** Material consisting of very large molecules, or macromolecules, composed of many repeating subunits.
- **Coding/Genetic Code?** Set of rules used by living cells to translate information encoded within genetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences of nucleotide triplets, or codons) into proteins
- **[DNA](https://sites.google.com/site/pingalacademy1/general-studies/general-science/chemistry/dna-deoxyribonucleic-acid)**
- **DNA Sequencing?** Process of determining the nucleic acid sequence â€“ the order of nucleotides in DNA.
- **Nucleotides?** are organic molecules consisting of a nucleoside and a phosphate.
- **RNA-Seq / RNA-Sequencing?** RNA-Seq is a sequencing technique which uses next-generation sequencing (NGS).
