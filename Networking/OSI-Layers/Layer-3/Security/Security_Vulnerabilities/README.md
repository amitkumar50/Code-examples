## Security Vulnerabilities
- **[ARP Vulnerability](/Networking/OSI-Layers/Between_L2_L3/Protocols):** ARP Spoofing
- **Brute Force**
  - Trying every combination of username/password using high-end machine. Types of BF:
    - *1. Dictionary attack:* attacker works through a dictionary of possible passwords and tries them all.
    - *2. Credential Recycling:* Reusing usernames and passwords from other data breaches to try to break into other systems
- **[DOS(DENIAL OF SERVICE)](DOS)**
- **DDOS(DISTRIBUTED DOS)/BOTNET:** 
  - Same as DOS, its objective is also to overwhelm the server. Here attack traffic originates from multiple nodes(distributed over the network) maybe 1000s of devices overwhelming the server at same time. 
  - This can be achieved using malware installed on compromised machines.
- **[Identity Attack](Identity_Attack)** 
- **KERNEL MELTDOWN/SPECTRE (1/Mar/18):** 
  - Race condition(between memory access and privilege checking during instruction processing) present in CPU of Intel x86 microprocessors.
  - An unauthorized process can read data from any address that is mapped to the current process's memory space
- **[Replay/Playback Attack](Replay_Attack)**
- **[Samba Bugs](Samba_Bugs):** Wannacry/Ransomeware, Badlock, SMB Signing disabled
- **[SSL Vulnerabilities](/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer5/Protocols/Encryption_Authentication/SSL_TLS)**
