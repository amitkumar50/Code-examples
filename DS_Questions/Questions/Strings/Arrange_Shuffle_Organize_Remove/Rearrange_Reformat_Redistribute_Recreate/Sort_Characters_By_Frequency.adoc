== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/[451. Sort Characters By Frequency]
Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.
```c
Example 1:
Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:
Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```

== Approach. O(n). HashMap+MaxHeap
=== Logic
* Count freq of characters in HashMap<char, int>
* Create max_heap<int, char>. Now most frequent char will be at top
* Iterate, pop() max_heap and create output string

=== Complexity
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n)

=== Code
==== CPP11
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string frequencySort(string s) {

        // Count freq using HashMap. O(n)
        unordered_map<char, int> um;
        for(auto&i:s)
            um[i]++;

        // Copy map to max_heap. O(m). m=unique characters
        using mpair = pair<int, char>;
        priority_queue<mpair> pq;
        for (const auto&[key, val]:um)
            pq.push({val, key});

        // Create output string from max_heap. O(m)
        string out;
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            mpair p = pq.top(); pq.pop();
            for (int i=0;i<p.first; i++) {
                out += p.second;
            }
        }
        return out;
    }
};
```
