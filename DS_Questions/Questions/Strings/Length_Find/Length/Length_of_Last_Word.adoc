* Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
* A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.
```c
Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

Example 2:
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

Example 3:
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
```

== Approach-1. Traverse from back. O(n)
=== Logic
* Start traversing string from back until string len == 0
* Keep increasing len variable to keep track of characters traversed.
* When 1st space is found return len.

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int i = s.size() -1, len = 0;  
        //Remove trailing whitespaces (if any)
        while (s[i]==' ')
            i--;
        while (i>=0) {
            if (s[i] != ' ')
                len += 1;
            else
                break;
            i--;
        }
        return len;
    }
};
```
