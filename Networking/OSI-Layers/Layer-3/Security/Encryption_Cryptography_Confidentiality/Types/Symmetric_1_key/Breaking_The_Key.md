## Crytanalysis
- **What?** Means breaking ciphers.

## Methods
### 1. Method-1. Comprehending 
- *a.* Read bits in cipher-text, Guess the pattern if bits differ is small.

### 2. Method-2
- *a.* XOR predicted plain-text with cipher-text. It can break weak cipher in only 2<sup>43</sup> combinations.
- *b.* When done repeatedly, helf bits becomes 0 and other 1s.

### 3. Method-3: Measuring electrical power
