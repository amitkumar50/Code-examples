## Constraints for RESTFUL application: 
- **a. Uniform interface:**
  - client request must include a resource identifier. The response the server returns include enough information so the client can modify the resource.
- **b. Client - server separation:** 
  - The client and the server act independently, each on its own, and the interaction between them is only in the form of requests, initiated by the client only.
- **c. Stateless:** Server does not store information about client who uses the APIs.
- **d. Layered system:** 
  - Between the client who requests a representation of a resourceâ€™s state, and the server who sends the response back, there might be a number of servers in the middle.These servers might provide a security, caching, load-balancing layers or                 other functionality. 
- **e. Cacheable:** 
  - Data sent by server contains information about whether or not the data is cacheable. If the data is cacheable, it might contain sort of a version number. Since the client knows which version of the data it has the client can avoid requesting the                         same data again.
- **f. Code-on-demand(optional):** 
  - The client can request code from the server, and then the response from the server will contain some code, usually in the form of a script. The client then can execute that code.
