Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

```c
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

== Approach. Time: O(n), Space: O(1)
=== Logic
* Sum of n natural numbers = n(n+1)/2 //1,2,3,4,5..n
* Question provides whole numbers //0,1,2,3,4...
* Actual Sum = (sum of n natural numbers) - (last natural no)
* Current Sum = //This will not include missing number.
* Missing number = ActualSum - CurrentSum

=== Complexity
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(1), not included stack frame space occupied by Function itself.

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    using vec = vector<int>;
    
    int missingNumber(vec& nums) {
        long CurrentSum = 0;
        int size = nums.size()+1;
        long ActualSum = (size*(size+1))/2 - size;
        
        //Traverse the array
        for (auto i:nums)
            CurrentSum += i;
        
        return ActualSum - CurrentSum;
    }
};
```

==== Rust
```rs
impl Solution {
    pub fn missing_number(nums: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
        let mut current_sum = 0;
        let size = nums.len() as i64 + 1;
        let actual_sum:i64 = (size*(size+1))/2 - size;

        //Traverse the array
        for i in nums.iter() {
            current_sum += i;
        }
        
        actual_sum as i32 - current_sum     
    }
}
```

==== Python
```py
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        current_sum = 0
        size = len(nums) + 1
        actual_sum = (size*(size+1))//2 - size

        for i in nums:
            current_sum += i

        return actual_sum - current_sum
```

==== Go
```go
func missingNumber(nums []int) int {
    current_sum := 0
    size := len(nums) + 1
    actual_sum := (size*(size+1))/2 - size

    //Traverse the array
    for _, i := range nums {
        current_sum += i
    }
    
    return actual_sum - current_sum     
}
```
