# Graphics Card
## What
  - Used in gaming PC or a professional high-performance PC for graphic processing.
  - It has different components that work altogether for graphics processing.
  
## Components of Graphics Card

- **GPU** See GPU.md page
- **VRAM(Video RAM)** 
  - All the graphics data and game textures are stored for processing by the GPU
  - Faster memory can really increase the graphics card performance to a certain level.
  - Graphics card memory includes DDR3, GDDR5, GDDR5X, HBM, and HBM2 RAM. DDR3 is the oldest and slowest of all.
- **VRM(Voltage Regulator Module)/(PPM)Processor Power Module/Voltage Regulator**
  - The main circuitry that powers the GPU. 
  - It converts 12V to around 1V to 1.5V (approx) which is normally the voltage level at which GPU operates.
  - No of VRMs on a graphics card varies from card to card. 
  - VRMs can get very hot & require good cooling to keep the graphics card from shutting down.
- **Cooler**
  - Every graphics card comes with Cooler to keep the temperature of GPU, VRAM, and VRM down to safer levels.
  - Some of the high-end graphics cards also come with Liquid / Water Cooling or Hybrid Cooling Solution      
  - Coolers can be either active or passive.
    - Active cooler: Has both heatsink and fan (HSF)
    - Passive cooler: Has the only heatsink
- **PCB(Printed Circuit Board)**
  - Base or board where all the components including GPU, VRAM, VRM, Capacitors, Sensors, etc, and Display Ports are mounted.
  - High-end graphics cards have more components so they require larger PCB compared to mi-range and entry-level graphics cards.
- **Connectors of Graphcis Cards**
  - ***PCI Express x16 Connector***
    - The interface through which graphics cards communicate with the motherboard and processor.
    - Older interfaces are PCI and AGP which are outdated and are not used now
  - ***6-Pin & 8-Pin PCI-E Connectors***
    - *Usage* Needed when Graphics cards need higher power. This connector provides external power from the PSU.
