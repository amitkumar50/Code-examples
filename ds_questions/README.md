## Big O(n)
- **Complexity**
	- worst-case: maximum number of steps taken in any instance of size n
	- best-case: minimum number of steps taken in any instance of size n.
	- average-case: average number of steps over all instances of size n
- **Rules**
	- Ignore the difference between multiplicative constants.	f(n) = 2n and g(n) = n are identical
