## Super Scaler CPU
- **What?** In contrast to 1 pipeline, Multiple units are present:
  - Multiple execution units. Eg one for integer arithmetic, one for floating-point arithmetic, and one for Boolean operations
  - Multiple Fetch Units. 2 or more instructions are fetched at once, decoded, and dumped into a holding buffer until they can be executed.
