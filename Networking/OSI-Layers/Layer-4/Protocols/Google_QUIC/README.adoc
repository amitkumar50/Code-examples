* In 2012, Google started developing QUIC. 2014 QUIC is used on all Google services, Chrome, and mobile apps.
* QUIC takes: Reliablilty from TCP, Fast/Rapidity from link:../UDP[UDP]

=== Improvements over TCP
* *1. TCP+link:https://sites.google.com/site/amitinterviewpreparation/networking/layer5/ssl[TLS] need 2 seperate handshakes. QUIC does in 1 message
** QUIC does Connection Establishment in just 1 packet.
** TCP Handshake(3 packets) + TLS Handshake(4 packets)

* *2. 0-RTT connection latency*
** Clients those have previously communicated with a server can start a new session without a three-way handshake, using limited state stored at clients and servers.
** This happens 75% the time

* *link:../../TCP/Advantages_Disadv_of_TCP[3. Head of line blocking issue in TCP]

* *link:../../TCP/Characteristics/Flow_and_Congestion_Control[4. Improved Congestion Control wrt TCP]*
** Since UDP is connectionless, all connections are handled by QUIC.
** QUIC implements Congestion control Algos without going to kernel.

* *5. Does not use TCP's SACK for lost packets*
** QUIC uses Packet number for packet ordering. 
** Each Packet Number is strictly incremented, so if Packet-4 is lost and Packet-5 arrives. Reciever knows Packet-4 is lost.
