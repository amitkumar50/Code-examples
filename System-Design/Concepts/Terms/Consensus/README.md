# Consensus
Several nodes to agree on something.

### Situations where consensus is needed
#### 1. Leader Election
- In a database with single-leader replication, all nodes need to agree on which node would be the leader.
- _How election happens?_
  - Every time the current leader is thought to be dead, a vote is started among the nodes to elect a new leader.
  - This election is given an incremented epoch number(which is totally ordered and monotonically increasing).
  - If there is a conflict between 2 different leaders in 2 different epochs (perhaps because the previous leader actually wasnâ€™t dead & came up later), then the leader with the higher epoch number prevails.
#### [2. Atomic commit](#ac)

## Atomic Commit
- **What?**
  - In system where a transaction writing/commits spans over several nodes/partitions, problem is that a transaction may fail on some nodes but succeed on others.
  - Consensus need to be maintained that either they all abort/roll back (if anything goes wrong) or they all commit (if nothing goes wrong) else data becomes inconsistent.
- **Atomic Commit Problem?** Some nodes commit the transaction but others abort it, the nodes become inconsistent with each other and so as data.

### Solution-1 (2 Phase Commit / Blocking Atomic Commit)
- 2PC ensures that either all nodes commit or all nodes abort.
- A transaction commit must be IRREVOCABLE: ie once node decides to commit, then there is no turning back. Reason: Once data has been committed, it becomes visible to other transactions, and thus other clients may start relying on that data; this principle forms the basis of read committed isolation.
- **NOTE:** 2PC and 2PL(2 Phase lock) are different. 2PC provides atomic commit in a distributed database, whereas 2PL provides serializable isolation.

#### Working of 2PC (A Definite Promise)
- **Elements:**
  - _1. Coordinator/Transaction Manager:_ This is a new component comes in that does not normally appear in single-node transactions. Eg: Narayana, JOTM, BTM, or MSDTC.
```c
1. Application sends connect message.
2. Coordinator generates globally unique transactionId and sends to Application. Now-on-wards application will use same id for communication.
3. Application sends data to write with transactionId.
4. Coordinator sends Prepare message(with transactionId) asking nodes whether they can commit or not?
5. When Node recieves prepare, it makes sure that it can commit to Disk at any cost.
  - Even if Node crashes After sending Yes. Then after recovery it has to commit the transaction. There is no turning Back.
  - DOUBT/UNCETAIN STATE: Coordinator sends prepare, Node voted Yes, and Coordinator crashes. Now Node is in Doubt state. Node will wait forever for Coordinator to send Phase-2 message(Commit or Abort).
  - HEURISTICS DECISIONS: Nodes can communicate & decide amongst themseleves once did not hear from Coordinator for particular time.
6. Coordinator recieves response from all nodes. This is called COMMIT POINT. Coordinator writes its decision to Transaction log.
  if (all respond yes)
    Phase-2: Sends Message. Nodes Commit
  else  //if any one says no
    Phase-2: Send Abort Message to all nodes

### Properties of Consensus Algorithm
- **1. Uniform agreement:** No two nodes decide differently.
- **2. Integrity:** No node decides twice.
- **3. Validity:** If a node decides value v, then v was proposed by some node.
- **4. Termination:** Every node that does not crash eventually decides some value.

### Disadv/Problems in Consensus
- _1. Minimum more than 50% nodes should be alive:_
  - if 5 nodes are there, 3 should be alive. if 10 are there 6 should be alive.
- _2. Performance degradation on Frequent Leader election:_
  - if in some scenario leaders kept on dying, or network is flaky then leader election will happen more frequently that results in performance loss, since leader election is not major goal of cluster.
  - System bouncing between 2 leaders.
