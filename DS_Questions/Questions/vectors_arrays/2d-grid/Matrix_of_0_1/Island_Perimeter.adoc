== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/[463. Island Perimeter]
You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

```c
Example 1:
Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
Output: 16
Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image above.

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1]]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,0]]
Output: 4
```

== Approach-1. O(mn). Iterate every element
=== Logic
* Iterate over array and find 1
```c
  0 1 0 0
  1 1 1 0
  0 1 0 0
  1 1 0 0

element        perimeter  Reason
a[0][1] = 1      3        Border will have perimeter=1, 2 sides have 0
```
* Whenever 1 is found, calculate that element's perimeter.
** if this element is on boundary wall of matrix (add 1)
** if neighbour element=0 (add 1)

=== Complexity
* Time: O(mn)
* Space: O(1)

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
using vvI = vector<vector<int>>;
class Solution {
	int rows, cols;
	int find_perim(int r, int c, vvI& v) {
		/*
		* if neighbour cell is 0, then add 1 to perimeter
		* if this is border cell, add 1 to perimeter
		* if neighbour is 1 donot add to perimeter
		*/
		int perimeter = 0;	//Perimeter of this cell
		int row_dir[] = {-1,0,0,1};
		int col_dir[] = {0,1,-1,0};
		for (int i = 0;i < 4;i++) {
			int neigh_row = r + row_dir[i];
			int neigh_col = c + col_dir[i];

            // if this element is on boundary, add 1 to perimeter
			if (neigh_row < 0 || neigh_row >= rows ||
				neigh_col < 0 || neigh_col >= cols) {
				perimeter += 1;
				continue;
			}
            // if neighbbour element is 0, add 1 to perimeter
			if (v[neigh_row][neigh_col] == 0)
				perimeter += 1;
		}
		return perimeter;
	}    
public:
    int islandPerimeter(vector<vector<int>>& v) {
		int out = 0;
		rows = v.size();
		cols = v[0].size();
		for (int i = 0;i < rows; ++i) {
			for (int j = 0;j < cols; ++j) {
				if (v[i][j] == 1) {
					out += find_perim(i, j, v);
				}
			}
		}
		return out;
    }
