- how vlan differentiates between packets
- symbol table
- hard link,soft link. Can hard link be created on directories?


Round-3(Technical):
 1. How to know what all files were opened by binary in past?
 2. Macro for returning maximum number?
 3. System calls vs normal function calls

   b. How to reduce resources consumed by system calls?
 4. Write fp is a pointer to function (pointer to function (void) returning void) returning array of 10 integers
