## BigTable
- This is distributed storage system that scales to large size(Petabytes) and distributed over 1000's of comodity servers.
- Projects storing data in BigTable: web indexing, Google Earth, and Google Finance.

<a name=datamodel></a>
## Data Model
- BigTable stores data in Multidimensinal sorted Map `<Key,value>`. Map is indexed using (row key + coloumn key + timestamp), value = Array of bytes.
- Stores data in lexicographic order by row key.
```c
(rowKey:string(64kb), column:string, time:int64) â†’ string

Example: Storing webpage

          col0 = Content            col1=Anchor  col2=Anchor
 0 | abc_t1 - def_t2 - hij_t3    |  cnn.com    | test.com   |
 
 [0][0] contains page contents at different timestamps
 [0][1] contains any anchors that references the page. websites
 [0][2] same as col1
```

### 1. Row Range = Tablets
- n rows are grouped together to form a **tablet**, which is the unit of distribution and load balancing.

### 2. How read operation is faster
- For example, in Webtable, pages in the same domain are grouped together into contiguous rows by reversing the hostname components of the URLs.
- Eg: store `maps.google.com/index.html` under the key `com.google.maps/index.html`. Storing pages from the same domain near each other makes some host and domain analyses more efficient.
