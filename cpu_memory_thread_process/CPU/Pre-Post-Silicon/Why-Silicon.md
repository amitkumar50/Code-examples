## Silicon(Si)
- All devices supercomputers, smart phones, air microwave ovens are made of silicon chip.

## Why Si is used in making Electronic devices?
- Abundance on earth's crust(8th most abundant element on earth) hence cheap.
- Properties of silicon
1. It is **semiconductor**(conducts electricity under some conditions and acts as an insulator under others).
2. Using **doping**(mixing impurities into element to modify its electrical properties).
   - Silicon is doped and it starts amplfiying electrical signals and hence becomes ideal for making transistors.
