### Problem
- Number "s" is given in binary representation. Return the number of steps to reduce it to 1 under the following rules:
 - If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2.
 - If the current number is odd, you have to add 1 to it.
- Example
```c++
Input: s = "1101"
Output: 8
Goal: make the string s=="0".
```
