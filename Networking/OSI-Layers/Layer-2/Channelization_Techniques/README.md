## Channelization Techniques
- **What?** How channels/time bands are allocated to users.

### Types
- **1a. FDMA(Frequency Division Multiple Access):**
  - Used for Analog transmissions. Each sender is given different frequency to send data.
    - Radio Stations Frequency: 95MHz -> 95FM.   98.3 - 100MHz -> 98.3FM
    - Human hearing range is 12kHz-14KHz
- **2. TDMA(TIME DIVISION MULTIPLE ACCESS):** 
  - Used in Digital Only.  In each time slot, n number of users are possible. Allocation may change during time. GSM (2G) uses this technology
- **3. CDMA(CODE DIVISION MULTIPLE ACCESS):** 
  - All users send data at 1 time, at 1 freq only but all have different codes
