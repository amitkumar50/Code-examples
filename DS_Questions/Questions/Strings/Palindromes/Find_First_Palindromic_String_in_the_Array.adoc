Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string "".

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

```c
Example 1:

Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
Output: "ada"
Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.
```

== Approach-1
=== Logic
* Read every word and check palindrome, as soon we find 1st palindrome return it

=== Complexity
* Time: O(mn). m=number of words, n=count of letters in words.
* Space: O(1). No extra space

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string firstPalindrome(vector<string>& words) {
        string out;
        auto isPalindrome = [](const string& word) {
            int start = 0, end = word.size() - 1;
            while (start < end) {
                if (word[start++] != word[end--])
                    return false;
            }
            return true;
        };
        
        for (const auto& word : words) {
            if (isPalindrome(word))
                return word;
        }
        return out;
    }   
};
```
