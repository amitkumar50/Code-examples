## Singleton DP / Single Object
- **What?** Only 1 object of class can be created. And provides Global point of access to it.
- **How Singleton is Achieved?**
  - *1.* Block all Object creation methods: 
	  - Make default ctr pvt
	  - Make copy ctr pvt
	  - Make Assignment operator pvt
  - *2.* Static variable to save Object address, since only 1 static variable exists/class.
  - *3.* Static Method to create Objects, static variables can be manipulated inside static methods.
  - *4.* Call static method from main(), to create Object.
- **Can't task of Singleton is done by Global variable?**   
  - Ans- No, Global needs to be created at start of program & exist till end, But singleton creates object when its required.
