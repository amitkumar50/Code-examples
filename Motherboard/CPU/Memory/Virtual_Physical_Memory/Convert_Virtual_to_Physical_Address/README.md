### Virtual Memory on 16 bit System = 16 bit bus 
- **Address Bus?**
  - Can access 2<sup>16</sup> = 65535 = 64KB Memory. To address 65536 17 bits are needed.
  - On 16 bit system you can plug huge Hard disk but that will be no use, since in 1 go Only 2 bytes can be accessed.

- **Converting Virtual to Physical Address** 
  - [Virtual Memory/Hard Disk=64KB, Physical Memory/RAM=32KB](Converting_Virtual_to_Physical_Address/HardDisk=64KB_RAM=32KB.md)
  - [32 Bit system](Converting_Virtual_to_Physical_Address)
