## Graph
- **What?**
  - Collection of nodes/vertices with edges between some/all of them. Examples: Internet, City map, Person's Social Network, State machines
  - VERTEX/NODE? Interconnected objects are called vertices.
  - EDGE/ARC/LINE? Links connecting the nodes. Links can be directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted. Weight also means cost.

    0 ------- 1        //Nodes: 0,1,2,3
    |         |        //Edges ={01, 12, 23, 03}
    3 ------- 2
