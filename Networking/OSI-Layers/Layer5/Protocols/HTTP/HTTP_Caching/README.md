## Caching
- **Why?** 
  - User(s) often request same Web page that they have used before and page contents(eg: images, CSS, scripts) donot change so often. 
  - Its network BW consumption and time wastage to fetch these resources again when browser has a copy.
- **What?** Caching less frequently changing pages. Eg: New-site pages would change often(not good candidate for caching). Information about Gods(good candidate for caching, as not change often).
