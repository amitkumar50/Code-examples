## Metal,Insulator,SemiConductor

### A. Terms
#### 1. Energy Bands
  - **What** According to band theory, the electrons in a solid can possess bands of energies called allowed bands of energies and these electrons may not possess some other bands of energies called forbidden bands of energies. 
  - **Forbidden Band/Band Gap** Band seperating valance and conduction band.
  - **Valance Band** highest range of electron energies in which electrons are present at 0 temperature.
  - **Conduction Band** topmost band of energy
#### 2. Electrical Conductivity
  - 
  
### B. Comparison
- **Metals**
  - Valance & conduction band overlap. No band gap here.
  - At zero temperature large number of electrons remains in the conduction band.
  - Electricity can pass easily b/w them.
- **Semiconductor**
  - Partially full valence band and partially full conduction band at the room temperature.
  - These are insulators at room temp, increasing of temperature the electrical conductivity of semiconductors increase.
- **Insulator**
  - Poor conductor of electricity.
