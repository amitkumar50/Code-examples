# Containers
- Isolated(Isolation is achieved using kernel namespace, [cgroups](/Operating_Systems/Linux/Resource_Control)) processes running on single host. Isolated from other processes.
- Only 1 Application can run inside container and all its dependent libraries. Each container has its own: Network interface, IP address, file system, All containers share the kernel of the host.
- **Containerization** Packaging software code and all its dependencies in a bundle.

<img src=TraditionalOS_vs_Containers.jpg width=400 />

<a name=add></a>
**Advantages**
- *1. lightweight* Use less memory:* Simple web application running inside container takes 100MB space.
- *2. Secure:* Reduces the chance that malicious code present in one container impacting other containers or invade the host system.
- *3. Portable:* abstraction from the host operating system makes containerized applications portable ie able to run on any OS,VM.

**Disadvantages:** Some application may not be suited for a containerized environment. Ex: applications accessing low-level hardware information.

### Container vs VM
```c
                 Container   |     VM
-----------|-----------------|--------------------  
size       |    smaller      | Bigger wrt container
capability |    smaller      | big
What       | Pacakaged s/w   | Copy of OS 
```

<a name=isc></a>
### Issues without containers
- When an company develops an S/W-Application, its tightly coupled with Libraries provided by particular OS Version. 
- If OS update happens, libraries would get updated and Application may break, as it depends on particular OS version libraries.

# Docker
Docker is one of [container](#con) implementation. Others are Rocket, Drawbridge, LXC.
- *Docker Inc.* is the company that sells the commercial version of Docker. Docker is also available as open source.
- **Docker Daemon / dockerd?** Manages Docker objects(Eg: Images, containers, networks, and volumes). dockerd also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.
- **Docker client / docker?** Users interact with docker client.
```c
  User 
$ docker run -----> [Docker Client]
                             --------------> [Docker Daemon/dockerd]
```

<a name=dterms></a>
### Docker Terms
- **Docker Host** Machine on which the Docker containers run. It can be a virtual machine or a physical machine.
- **Docker Image**
  - RO template with instructions for creating a Docker container. We can create our own images or use those created by others and published in a registry.Docker image is created using Docker File.
- **Docker File:** Creation of Docker images is done using docker files. This is shell script for installing the s/w.
```sh
//////docker_file.sh//////////////
FROM openjdk:11.0.2-jre-slim                            //base image on which the installation is based
COPY target/customer.jar .                              //copies files in the Docker image
CMD /usr/bin/java -Xmx400m -Xms400m -jar customer.jar   //what happens when the Docker container is started
EXPOSE 8080                                             //Port on which docker is available

/////Building docker image
# docker build --tag=<tag-name-of-image> <directory-name-where-docker-file-is-present>    //docker is command line tool
```
- **Docker Registry (hub.docker.com):** Stores docker images. Same as github,gitlab are for source code.
- **Docker Compose** [Microservices](/System-Design/Concepts/MicroServices) can contact other microservice using DC. DC uses yaml configuration file.
 ```yaml
 $ cat docker-compose.yml
 version: '3'
services:
  common:                                   // is a web application that is supposed to deliver common artifacts.
    build: ../scs-demo-esi-common/
  order:                                   //is a web application for processing orders.
    build: ../scs-demo-esi-order
  varnish:                                //is a web cache to coordinate the two web applications.
    build: varnish
    links:
     - common
     - order
    ports:
     - "8080:8080"
 ```

### Install Docker, Run Container
```c
//////Install////////
1. Download Docker Installer from https://hub.docker.com/.
2. Check Hyper-V and Containers Windows features must be enabled.

/////Running Container///
$ cd C:/Users/amit/                                               //Start docker from desktop. It will present a CLI. 
$ git clone https://github.com/docker/getting-started.git         //Clone the tutorial repo to build the docker image. 
$ cd getting-started; docker build -t docker101tutorial .         //Build the Docker Image
$ docker run -d -p 80:80 -name docker-tutorial docker101tutorial` //Start the Container based on image build in step-3. 
```

<a name=dn></a>
## Docker Networking
Connecting Docker Containers with each other and with outside world. Dockerâ€™s networking subsystem is pluggable using drivers forming networks.
- **Types of Docker Networking**
```c
      Network      |        Description
-------------------|-----------------------------
  1.Bridge         |  default network driver
  2.Host           |  Use Host Networking
  3.Overlay        |  Containers running on **different Docker hosts** want to communicate OR when multiple applications work together using swarm services
  4.macvlan        |  Assign a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device
  5.None           |  disable all networking. This is not available for swarm services.
  6.Network Plugins|  Integrate Docker with specialized network stacks/3rd party stacks.
```

<a name=bn></a>
### 1. Bridge Networking
This is default network driver. Used when multiple containers want to communicate on the **same Docker host**.
- **Types of Bridge**
```c
                    User Defined          |         Default Bridge
----------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------
What      | Can only connect using        | This is created by default, but its better to use user defined bridge
            IP Address or hostname          Can only connect using IP Address.
Isolation | provides a scoped network in  | Not better
            which only containers attached 
            to that network are able to 
            communicate
```

```

<a name=dcm></a>
### [Docker commands](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/docker/)
```
$ docker
  -d: start the container detached (in the background)
  -i: Interactive, (with the ability to type into it)
  --network host: Start host driver
  --rm: remove the container once it exits/stops. 
  -t: With tty
```

### 2. None Networking
This completely disables the networking stack on the container. Within the container, only the loopback device is created. Example:
```c
$ docker run --rm -dit  --network none  --name no-net-alpine   alpine:latest   ash

//Check the containerâ€™s network stack... no eth0 created
$ docker exec no-net-alpine ip link show
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN qlen 1
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: tunl0@NONE: <NOARP> mtu 1480 qdisc noop state DOWN qlen 1
    link/ipip 0.0.0.0 brd 0.0.0.0
3: ip6tnl0@NONE: <NOARP> mtu 1452 qdisc noop state DOWN qlen 1
    link/tunnel6 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00
    
//Stop the container. It is removed automatically because it was created with the --rm flag
$ docker stop no-net-alpine    
```

<a name=hn></a>
### 3. Host Networking
[Container's](#con) network stack is same as host network stack. IP Address of container is same as host OS. Useful in situtation where container needs to listen/read/write on large number of ports.
- **Advantages**
  - *1.* Expose 1 port and IP access the service. Example: 50 Game servers are running in Docker containers on same host. Requests are routed using [kubernets](/System-Design/Concepts/All_About_Containers/Container_Orchestration) to free game server.
- **Disadvantages:** Host networking driver only work on linux not on Windows and MAC. 
 
<a name=egn></a>
#### Example: Nginx container binds directly to port 80 on the Docker host
Start ngnix in container with host networking, ngnix listens on port 80 which is same as docker host.
```c
# docker run --rm -d --network host --name my_nginx nginx         //Create and start container as detached process
# ip addr show 
# sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :80                                  //Check which process is binded to port 80.
# docker container stop my_nginx                                  //Stop the container, it will be removed automatically since start with -rm switch
```

# Container Orchestration
**Orhestration?** Managing the lifecycles of containers, these are GUI/tools to automate following tasks: Deployment, Scaling up/down, Movement of containers from one host to another, Load balancing, Health monitoring.
  - *Examples of Container Orhestrators:* Kubernets, Docker swarm, Nomad

<a name=kub></a>
## Kubernets Architecture : 1 master, n worker nodes

<a name=mn></a>
### A. Master Node
- **Reponsibilities:** Create/destroy worker nodes. User can only interacts with master node using yaml file.
- **Daemon in master node**
  - *1. Controller Manager:* Monitors created containers/worker nodes. When worker node finishes the task(or load on cluster is low). VM/Worker node is bought down and when load becomes high a new worker node/VM is spawned again.
  - *2. API Service:* Manages all communication with Worker nodes(using kubelet)
  - _3. Scheduler:_ For placing pods across nodes to balance resource consumption.
  - 4. _etcd:_ Database that hosts cluster state information.

<a name=wn></a>
### B. Worker Node
- **Reponsibilities:** Handling workload.
- **Daemons in worker node**
  - *1. Kubelet:* Process for communication with master.
  - *2. [Docker](#doc):* A container runtime.
  - *3. Kube Proxy:* Does communication with other nodes in cluster.
- **Architecture:** 
Worker nodes hosts [PODS](#pod)(most atomic unit of kubernets). These pods can contain 1 or more [containers](#con).
```c

User(application.yaml)      <----Master_Node-------->         <---- Worker_Node-1 -->
   --------------------->   Controller    API_service<------->Kubectl   Kubectl_Proxy------> Worker_Node-2
                                                                                   |-------> Worker_Node-3                   
```

<a name=pod></a>
#### POD 
- Complete package which Kubernets creates to install application on Worker Node. Pod can contain multiple containers(application)w. Pods run in isolated pvt enviornment. Pod Contains:
  - *1.* Container(Eg: [Docker](#doc))
  - *2.* Shared storage, as Volumes
  - *3.* Networking, as a unique cluster IP address
  - *4.* Information about how to run each container, such as the container image version or specific ports to use

#### Namespaces
Virtual clusters inside kubernets cluster. 3 predefined namespaces:
- _1. Default:_ 
- _2. Kube-system:_ resources created by kubernets.
- _3. Kube-public:_ reserved for future.
```c
$ kubectl crete namespace test                        //Creating new namespace
$ kubectl --namespace=test  run ngnix --image=nginx   //Deploy namespace
```
