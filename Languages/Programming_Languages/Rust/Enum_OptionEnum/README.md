## Enum
- **What?** Similar to other languages(but has additional features), Enums are User defined data type which can be assigned some limited values.
- **[Types?](Types)** In rust enum variable can or cannot hold the data (Eg: String). 
  - *1.* Enum Without Holding data
  - *2.* Enum which can hold data
- **Methods on enums**
  - As we can define [Methods on structs](../), we can also define methods on enums.
