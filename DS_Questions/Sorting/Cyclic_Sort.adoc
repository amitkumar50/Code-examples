== Cyclic Sort
* works for arrays containing values within a specific range
* It's an in-place, unstable algorithm that aims to sort the elements by arranging them in their correct positions, 1 at a time through a series of swaps.
* The basic idea is to iterate through the array and place each element in its intended position until the entire array is sorted.
* Example:
```cpp
arr = [5,2,4,3,1]
       0 1 2 3 4 

output = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

== Logic
* Input array is not sorted. 
* it is also assumed, input array have ALL elements from (1 to n), with no element missing. 
** Eg: (4,2,3,1) is valid input
** (6,2,3,4,1) is invalid since 5 is missing
* We check whether arr[i] is at its correct place or not?
```cpp
arr = [5,2,4,3,1]
       0 1 2 3 4 
```
* Assuming we have elements from {1 to n}. So 1's place is index=0, 2's place is index=1
** correct place for 5? index=4. 
** Correct place for 4? index=3.
** correct place of arr[i] is i-1

== Code
=== CPP
```cpp
int main() {
    vector<int> v = {5,2,4,3,1};
    int correct_index = 0;

    for (int i=1; i<=v.size(); i++) {
        //element v[i]. it correct place = i-1
        // if v[i] is not at correct place swap
        if (v[i-1] != i)
          swap (v[i-1], v[v[i-1] - 1]);
   }
    cout << "Sorted\n";
    for(auto&i:v)
        cout << i << " ";
    return 0;
}
```
