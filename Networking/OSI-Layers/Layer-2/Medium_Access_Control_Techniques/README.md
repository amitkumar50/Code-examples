## Medium Access Control Techniques
- **1. Pure Aloha:** 
  - Any node can send data anytime, if collision occurs nodes wait for random amount of time(Backoff time) and re transmits. Throughput=18%. Vulnerable Time: Time which is wasted due to collision
```c
[Node-1]          [Node-3]            node-2            Node-4
  |                  |                 |                    |
  -----------------------------------------------------------
```

- **2. Slotted Aloha:** Time is divided into slots, Throughput = 37%

- **3. [CSMA, CARRIER SENSE MULTIPLE ACCESS](CSMA)** 

- **4.
