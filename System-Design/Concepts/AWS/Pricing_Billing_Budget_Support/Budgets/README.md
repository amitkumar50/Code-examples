**Budgets**
- [Cost Explorer vs Budgets](/System-Design/Concepts/AWS/Pricing_Billing_Budget_Support/Cost_Explorer/README.md#vs)

## Budgets
- We can use budgets to plan service usage, service costs etc.
- We can set custom alerts whenever usage exceeds the amount msg is sent.
- Example:
  - We donot want to exceed 200$ on EC2 usage, we can set budget on 100$ to send alert whenever usage reaches 50%.
- We can create current, forecasted budgets which will show up in AWS Budgets page.
