  - **Sorting(Important)** Merge Sort, Quick Sort(Memorize Implementations)
  - sliding Windows
  - Greedy Algorithms
  - **Resource to learn from:** 1. CS 61 A    2. CS 61 B
  - **Practice portal** Leetcode(premium, as per company category)
  - **After Doing every question:** WRITE Down, 1 thing that would I have done/known to make this thing easier. CHANGE it and DONOT Repeat again.

    - *2.* Explain solution in plain english to yourself. (Step-by-step bullets)
    - *3.* Pseudo code
    - *4.* Functions
