## Scrum
- Scrum is one of the most popular frameworks for implementing Agile. Scrum and agile are not same things.
- With scrum, the product is built in a series of fixed-length iterations called sprints that give teams a framework for shipping software on a regular cadence.

## Terms

#### 1. Refactoring
To improve the performance or readability, the existing code is modified; this is re-factoring. During re-factoring the code functionality remains same.

<a name=sp></a>
#### 2. Sprint
- This is basic unit of development.
- _Sprint starts with:_ a planning meeting, where the tasks for the sprint are identified and an estimated commitment for the sprint goal is made.
- _Sprint ends with:_ a review or retrospective meeting where the progress is reviewed and lessons for the next sprint are identified. During each sprint, the team creates finished portions of a product.

#### 3. User Stories
- Features customers might want to see in their software. Typically no more than a couple days work, they form the basis of our Agile plans.
- Task: Further down user stories are broken down into different tasks.
- Epic: A customer described software feature that is itemized in the product backlog is known as epic. Epics are sub-divided into stories.

#### 4. Scrum Roles
- **Product Owner** They are focused on understanding business and market requirements, then prioritizing the work to be done by the engineering team accordingly.
- **Scrum Master** They coach the team, the product owner, and the business on the scrum process and look for ways to fine-tune their practice of it.
- **Scrum Team** These are cross-functional teams. Includes developers, testers, designers, and ops engineers in addition to developers.

#### 5. Scrum Task Board
- This is visual display of the progress of the Scrum team during a sprint. It presents a snapshot of the current sprint backlog allowing everyone to see which tasks remain to be started, which are in progress and which are done.
- Consider the following layout of the task board:
```c
Stories
To Do
In Progress
Testing
Done
```

#### 6. Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog
- **Product Backlog** is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product.
- **Sprint Backlog** is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint during the Sprint Planning, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.

## Agile
- Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach(framework) for software delivery that builds software incrementally, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.
- It works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called [user stories](#us), prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short two week cycles called **Agile iterations**.
- Agile refers to any process that aligns with the concepts of the Agile Manifesto.

#### 1. Agile iteration
- An Agile iteration is a short 1 to 2 week period where a team takes most important user stories, builds them completely and deliver as running-tested-software to the customer. Analysis, design, coding, testing happen during an iteration.

The burn-down chart shows the remaining work to complete before the timebox (iteration) ends.
