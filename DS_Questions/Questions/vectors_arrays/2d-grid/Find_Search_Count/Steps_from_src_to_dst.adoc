== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-a-cell-is-reachable-at-a-given-time/[2849. Determine if a Cell Is Reachable at a Given Time]
You are given four integers sx, sy, fx, fy, and a non-negative integer t.

In an infinite 2D grid, you start at the cell (sx, sy). Each second, you must move to any of its adjacent cells.

Return true if you can reach cell (fx, fy) after exactly t seconds, or false otherwise.

A cell's adjacent cells are the 8 cells around it that share at least one corner with it. You can visit the same cell several times.

```
Input: sx = 2, sy = 4, fx = 7, fy = 7, t = 6
Output: true
Explanation: Starting at cell (2, 4), we can reach cell (7, 7) in exactly 6 seconds by going through the cells depicted in the picture above. 
```

== Approach-1. distance = max(abs(startx-endx), abs(starty-endy))
=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isReachableAtTime(int sx, int sy, int fx, int fy, int t) {
        // Time to reach from src to dst
        int time_to_reach = max(abs(sx-fx), abs(sy-fy));

        if(time_to_reach > 0) {
            // if time needed to reach dst is smaller than t, return true
            if (t >= time_to_reach)
                return true;
        } else {
            // if steps are smaller than 0 and t!=1 return true 
            if (t!=1)
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
