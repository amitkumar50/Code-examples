An image smoother is a filter of the size 3 x 3 that can be applied to each cell of an image by rounding down the average of the cell 
and the eight surrounding cells (i.e., the average of the nine cells in the blue smoother). If one or more of the surrounding cells of a cell is not present, 
we do not consider it in the average (i.e., the average of the four cells in the red smoother)

```c
Input: img = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
1 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 1

Output: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0

Explanation:
For the points (0,0). Take avereage of all points around it (01,10,11)/4
For the point (1,1): Take avereage of all points around it (00,01,02,10,12,20,21,22)/9 
  Since point itself is also considered while taking average. floor(8/9) = floor(0.88888889) = 0
```

== Approach-1. Iterate complete array
=== Logic
* Traverse to every cell in matrix, find sum of all neighbouring elements including itself.
* Find average (sum of all neighbouring elements+self)/number of elements and store in out array.

=== Complexity
* Time: O(mn)
* Space: O(1)

=== Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int average(vector<vector<int>>& img, int r, int c, int nrows, int ncols) {
        int row[] = {-1,-1,-1,0,0,1,1,1};
        int col[] = {-1,0,1,-1,1,-1,0,1};
        long sum = img[r][c], count=1;
        for (int i=0;i<8;i++) {
            int rval = r + row[i];
            int cval = c + col[i];
            if (rval >= nrows || cval >= ncols || rval < 0 || cval < 0)
                continue;
            sum += img[rval][cval];
            count++;
        }
        return sum/count;
    }
    vector<vector<int>> imageSmoother(vector<vector<int>>& img) {
        int nrows = img.size();
        int ncols = img[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> out(nrows, vector<int>(ncols, 0));
        for (int i=0;i<nrows;++i) {
            for (int j=0;j<ncols;++j) {
                out[i][j] = average(img, i, j, nrows, ncols);
            }
        }
        return out;
    }
