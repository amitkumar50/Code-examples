## COPROCESSOR
- **What**
	- computer processor used to supplement the functions of the primary processor/CPU/mircoprocessor.
	- coprocessor shares same memory, IO devices, bus control, clocks as with CPU.
	- coprocessor has its own instruction set, which would be added to CPU
	- coprocessor can have upto ***60 cores*** in 1 package.
- **Usage**
	- Offloads processor-intensive tasks from the main processor and hence can accelerate system performance
- **Operations performed by the coprocessor**
	- floating point arithmetic, graphics, signal processing, string processing, cryptography or I/O interfacing with peripheral devices.	
- **Examples**
	- 8087 was 1st math coprocessor developed by intel.
	- GPU(Graphics Processing Units)
