## Advatanges of Overlay Network
- *1. Incremental deployment:* 
  - Overlay networks do not require changes to the existing routers. 
- *2. Adaptable:* 
  - The overlay algorithm can adjust number of metrics when making routing and forwarding decisions. Overlay can take application-specific concerns into account that are not currently offered by TCP/IP. 
    - Eg: latency, bandwidth, and security.
- *3. Robust:* 
  - Robust to node and network failures due high number of nodes in the overlay, the network may be able to offer multiple independent (router-disjoint) paths to the same destination.
