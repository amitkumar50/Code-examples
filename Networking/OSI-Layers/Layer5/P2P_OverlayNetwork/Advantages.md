- **Advatanges of Overlay Network**
  - *1. Incremental deployment:* 
    - Overlay networks do not require changes to the existing routers. 
  - *2. Adaptable:* 
    - The overlay algorithm can adjust number of metrics when making routing and forwarding decisions. Overlay can take application-specific concerns into account that are not currently offered by TCP/IP. 
      - Eg: latency, bandwidth, and security.
  - *3. Robust:* 
    - Robust to node and network failures due high number of nodes in the overlay, the network may be able to offer multiple independent (router-disjoint) paths to the same destination.

- **Advatanges of P2P**
  - *1. Dynamic membership?* P2P systems to be self organizing and can easily scale up/down as the number of peers can grow
  - *2. Better Bandwidth Utilization?* since the peers communicate directly with each other
  - *3. Fault tolerant* since no one node is more important the other
