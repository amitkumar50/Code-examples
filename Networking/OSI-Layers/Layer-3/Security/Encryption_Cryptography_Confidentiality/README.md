## Encryption / Cryptography / Confidentiality
- **What?** Conversion of Data/Plain-text into unreadable/cipher text.
- **Cryptanalysis?** Breaking ciphers. 
- **Kerckhoffâ€™s principle?** Whole world should know how crypto algorithm works, All algorithms must be public. Algorithm is parameterized by key only the keys are secret
- **CIPHER ALGORITHMS**
  - **1. Substitution Cipher:** each letter or group of letters is replaced by another letter or group of letters. Eg: Caesar ciphers(b becomes E, c becomes F)
  - **2. Block Ciphers(Mostly used):** Encrypt block of characters        
  - **2. Stream Ciphers(Obsolete):** Encrypt Single character at a time
- **Rounds?** There are more P-boxes at start and end.
- **Whitening?** XORing a random 64-bit key with plaintext before feeding it into Encryptor and then XORing a second 64-bit key with the resulting ciphertext before transmitting it. DES uses it.
- **Problem with Symmetric Key Algo?** AES,DES(or any) symmetric key algo have a problem that with same plaintext they will produce same ciphertext everytime.
  - **Solution: Chaining** 1st block is XORed with IV(initialization vector) then successive blocks are XORed with output of prev block and IV is sent with cipher text and reverse is done on receveing side.
- **Decryption?** All steps are just run in reverse order.  
  
### How Encryption is performed at H/W Level?
> ONLY POSITION OF BITS ARE CHANGED
- **A. PERMUTATION/P-BOX/TRANSPOSITION BOX:** Perform internal transposition(change place) and do it at practically the speed of light since no computation is involved, just signal propagation. Internal wiring is not known to world.
- **B. SUBSTITUTION/S-BOX:** This can have multiple stages of P-box inside providing more complex method bit position shifting. 
  - Product Cipher
    - Actual Cipher can use multiple P,S box stages inside to provide better cryptography. With large number of stages output can be a complicated function of the input. 
    - Actual implementations have minimum of 10 stages.
    - There are more P-boxes at start and end, called Rounds.

### How safe is 128 bit Key?
- The longer the key, higher work to be done by breaking algo.    {Email: 64-bit keys will do, Commercial applications: 128 bits, Govt org: 256 bits}
```c
    bits    No of Unique keys
    2                4
    3                8
    32            4,294,967,296    (4 billion)
    64            18,446,744,073,709,551,616 (18 Quintillion keys) = 18 x 1018
    128           340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456   ( 340,282,366,920,938,463,463 Quintillion keys) 
```    
- 1 super computer can perform 10<sup>17</sup> FLOPS (a hundred quadrillion FLOPS floating point operations per second)
  - Per Year = 3600(hour) x 24 x 30 x 12 = 31,104,000 x  10<sup>17</sup>= 31,104,00 Quintillion Operations.
  - 340,282,366,920,938,463,463 / 31,104,000 = 109,401,481,134,561 (approx) = 109 Trillion 
  
**109 Trillion super computers working parallelly for 1 year can produce all combinations of 128 bit key**
