**ECS**

## ECS(Elastic Container Service)
- [Container](/System-Design/Concepts/All_About_Containers/Container.md) management service on AWS. We can run containers on AWS using it.
- Amazon ECS supports Docker containers.


### AWS Fargate
  - This is an easy way to deploy your containers on AWS.
  - Fargate is like EC2 but instead of giving you a virtual machine you get a container.
