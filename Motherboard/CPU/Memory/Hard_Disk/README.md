## Hard Disk / Magnetic Disk
- Plate/Platters rotate at 5400, 7200, 10,800 rpm or more.
- Information is written onto the disk in concentric circles.
- *How Read Happens?* Suppose information is on track-2 and RW head is on track-1.
  - *1. Move the arm to track-2 (1 msec).* Moving one cylinder to the next takes about 1 msec.
  - *2. Drive rotates to get correct sector under RW head(5-10 msec).* 
  - *3. Read,write information (50-200 MB/sec)*
