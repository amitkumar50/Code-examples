== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/all-ancestors-of-a-node-in-a-directed-acyclic-graph/[2192. All Ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph]
You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive).

You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] denotes that there is a unidirectional edge from fromi to toi in the graph.

Return a list answer, where answer[i] is the list of ancestors of the ith node, sorted in ascending order.

A node u is an ancestor of another node v if u can reach v via a set of edges.

```c
Input: n = 8, edgeList = [[0,3],[0,4],[1,3],[2,4],[2,7],[3,5],[3,6],[3,7],[4,6]]
Output: [[],[],[],[0,1],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,2,3]]
Explanation:
The above diagram represents the input graph.
- Nodes 0, 1, and 2 do not have any ancestors.
- Node 3 has two ancestors 0 and 1.
- Node 4 has two ancestors 0 and 2.
- Node 5 has three ancestors 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 6 has five ancestors 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 7 has four ancestors 0, 1, 2, and 3.

== Approach-1. Hashmap of reverse relationship
=== Logic
* Construct a hashmap of child to parent
```c
unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>>
  key=child    value=direct parents
    3            0,1
    4            0,1,2
    5            3
    6            3,4
    7            2,3
```
* Traverse all childs, fill in direct parents, recursively jump to one of parent and find its parent
```c
parents of 6
    3    //jump to parents of 3 from hashmap
    0    //is there any parent of 0? No
    1    //is there any parent of 1? No
    4
    2
```

=== Complexity
* Time: O(mn). m=nodes, n=parents
* Space: O(mn). m=unordered_map, n=stack frames can be created at a time

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> getAncestors(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>> parentNodes;
        
        // Create a reverse relation map
        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            int child = edge[1];
            int parent = edge[0];
            parentNodes[child].insert(parent);
        }

        vector<vector<int>> out(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            unordered_set<int> ancestors;
            findParents(i, parentNodes, ancestors);
            out[i] = vector<int>(ancestors.begin(), ancestors.end());
            sort(out[i].begin(), out[i].end()); // Optional: sort the result
        }
        
        return out;
    }

private:
    void findParents(int start, 
                     unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>>& parentNodes, 
                     unordered_set<int>& ancestors) {
        if (parentNodes.find(start) == parentNodes.end()) {
            return;
        }
        for (auto& parent : parentNodes[start]) {
            if (ancestors.find(parent) == ancestors.end()) {
                ancestors.insert(parent);
                findParents(parent, parentNodes, ancestors);
            }
        }
    }
};
```
