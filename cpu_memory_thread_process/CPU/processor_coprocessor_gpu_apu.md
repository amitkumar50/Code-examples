## COPROCESSOR
- **What**
	- computer processor used to supplement the functions of the primary processor/CPU/mircoprocessor.
	- coprocessor shares same memory, IO devices, bus control, clocks as with CPU.
	- coprocessor has its own instruction set, which would be added to CPU
	- coprocessor can have upto ***60 cores*** in 1 package.
- **Usage**
	- Offloads processor-intensive tasks from the main processor and hence can accelerate system performance
- **Operations performed by the coprocessor**
	- floating point arithmetic, graphics, signal processing, string processing, cryptography or I/O interfacing with peripheral devices.	
- **Examples**
	- 8087 was 1st math coprocessor developed by intel.
	- GPU(Graphics Processing Units)
	
## GPU(Graphics Processing Unit)
- **What**
	- This is specialized electronic circuit created for manipulating images rapidly. ie Specialized in Graphics & Image processing.
	- GPUs are used in mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles.
	- They work on ***parallel computing***.
- **Usages**
	- Create high resolution images, videos
	- In machine training, deep learning neural networks, GPUs can be 250 times faster than CPUs.
	- Complex mathematical calculations.
	- financial simulations and risk modeling
- **Companies**
	- In 2018 AMD/ATI(33%) & Nvidia(66%) captured 100% of GPU market.
- **CPU vs GPU**

|  | CPU | GPU |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cores | 4 | Nvidia's GeForce:4000, AMD's Radeon: 2500, Intel's HD 500: 1100 |
| works on | | Parallelism |
| Tasks | varied:
