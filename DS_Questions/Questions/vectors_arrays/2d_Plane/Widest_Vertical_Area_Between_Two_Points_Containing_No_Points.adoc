Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.

```
Example 1:
Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.

Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
Output: 3
```

== Approach-1. Sort. O(nlogn). Find max distance between neighbouring x corrdinates
=== Logic
1. sort input point array
```
points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]

sorted
[[7,4],[8,7],[9,7],[9,9]]
```
2. Find distance between x coordinates.
```c
8-7=1
9-8=1
9-9=0
```

=== Complexity
* Time: O(nlogn) [Sorting] + O(n)
* Space: O(1)

=== Code
==== CPP98
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        sort(points.begin(), points.end());
        int maxi = INT_MIN;
        for (int i=0;i<points.size()-1;++i) {
            int x1 = points[i][0], x2 = points[i+1][0];
            maxi = std::max(maxi, x2-x1);
        }
        return maxi;
    }
};
```
==== CPP11
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        sort(points.begin(), points.end());
        int maxi = INT_MIN;
        for_each(points.begin(), points.end()-1, [&](const auto& point){
            auto nextPoint = std::next(&point);
            int x1 = point[0], x2 = (*nextPoint)[0];
            maxi = std::max(maxi, x2 - x1);
        });
        return maxi;
    }
};
```

== Approach-2(set<int>). O(nlogn)
=== Code
==== CPP11
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        set<int> st;
        int maxi = 0;
        for (const auto& i : points)
            st.insert(i[0]);

        for (auto it = st.begin(); std::next(it) != st.end(); it++) {
            int x1 = *it, x2 = *std::next(it);
            maxi = max(maxi, x2-x1);
        }
        return maxi;
    }
};
```
