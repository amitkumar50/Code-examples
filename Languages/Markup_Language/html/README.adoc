== Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
* Used to format the layout of a webpage. With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements
* CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

=== 1. Inline
using the style attribute inside HTML elements
```c
<h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">A red paragraph.</p>
```

=== 2. Internal
- using `<style>` element in the `<head>` section. Example:
```c
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {background-color: powderblue;}
h1   {color: blue;}
p    {color: red;}
</style>
</head>
<body>	
```

=== 3. External (`<link>` in `<head>`)
- An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.
- To use an external style sheet, add a `<link>` to it in the `<head>` section of each HTML page
```c
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
- style.css
```c
body {
  background-color: powderblue;
}
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
  border: 2px solid powderblue;		<!--CSS border property defines a border around an HTML element-->
  padding: 30px;			<!--defines a padding (space) between the text and the border-->
  margin: 50px;				<!--defines a margin (space) outside the border-->
  
}
```
