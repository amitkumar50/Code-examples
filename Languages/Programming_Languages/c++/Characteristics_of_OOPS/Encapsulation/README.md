## Encapsulation (Implements Data Hiding)
- Combining/bundling data & functions in 1 capsule called class. 
```c++
    --------------------------
    | methods | variables |            //capsule called class
    --------------------------
```
- DATA HIDING? 
  - Making class members private and accessing via public methods. If a field is declared private, it cannot be accessed by anyone outside the class, thereby hiding the fields within the class.
- ENCAPSULATION USAGE? 
  - The main benefit of encapsulation is the ability to modify our implemented code without breaking the code of others who use our code.
