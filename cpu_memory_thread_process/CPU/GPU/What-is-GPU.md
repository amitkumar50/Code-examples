# GPU(Graphics Processing Unit)
## What is GPU
- This is specialized electronic circuit created for manipulating images rapidly. ie Specialized in Graphics & Image processing.
- GPUs are used in mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles.
- They work on ***parallel computing***.
- **Companies** In 2018 AMD/ATI(33%) & Nvidia(66%) captured 100% of GPU market.	
## GPU Usages
- Create high resolution images, videos
- In machine training, deep learning neural networks, GPUs can be 250 times faster than CPUs.
- Complex mathematical calculations.
- financial simulations and risk modeling
