## Hypercube / n cubes
- This is undirected graph. 
- An n-dimensional hypercube has n cubes internally connected to each other.
- 0-cube(Point), 1-cube(line), 2-cube(square), 3-cube(cube), 4-cube(Tesseract), 5-cube(Penteract), ..
- An arbitrary k-ary n-cube can be constructed by adding dimensions in an iterative fashion.
