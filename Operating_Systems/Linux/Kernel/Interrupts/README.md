## Interrupt
- **What?** Interrupt is event generated by hardware(I/O Device) which is sent to CPU by Interrupt Controller. CPU is asked to perform some high priority task wrt what its doing. Information from interrupt(eg: key pressed) is converted to character and stored in buffer to be later used by ISR.
