## Makefile Having automatic Variables

[What are Automatic variables](https://github.com/amitkumar50/Code-examples/blob/master/programming_lang/C/Makefile/README.md)

### A. Source
```
// hello.c
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### B. Makefile (Must be tab stopped not spaces)
```
all: hello.exe                           //Running make without target hits `all`
 
hello.exe: hello.o
	gcc -o $@ $<                          //$< means 1st pre-requisite filename = hello.o
                                        //$@ means target file name = hello.exe
                                        //gcc -o $@ $<  = gcc -o hello.exe hello.o
                                        
hello.o: hello.c
	gcc -c $<                             //$< means 1st pre-requisite filename = hello.c
                                        //gcc -c $<  =  gcc -c hello.c
     
clean:
	rm hello.o hello.exe
```

### Steps Involved
#### `# make`
1. `make` command reaches `Rule = all`.
   - `Rule = all` has pre-requisite `hello.exe`(does not exist), so it looks for a rule to create it.
2. Reaches `Rule = hello.exe` 
   - Pre-requisite `hello.o`(does not exist) so it looks for a rule to create it.
3. Reaches `Rule = hello.o` 
   - Pre-requisite `hello.c`(exists).
   - Goes to command for execution `gcc -c $<` 
     - `$<` means 1st Pre-requisite filename. Hence `$< = hello.c`
     - `gcc -c $<` is converted to `gcc -c hello.c`
     - Runs the command `hello.o` created
   - Rule finishes, goes back to `Rule = hello.exe`
4. Reaches `Rule = hello.exe` 
   - Pre-requisite `hello.o`(exists)
     - `$<` means 1st Pre-requisite filename. `$< = hello.o`
     - `$@` means Target Filename, name of the file being generated. `$@ = hello.exe`
   - Commands `gcc -o $@ $<` is converted to `gcc -o hello.exe hello.o` internally
5. Finally, `Rule = all` does nothing.

#### `# make clean`
