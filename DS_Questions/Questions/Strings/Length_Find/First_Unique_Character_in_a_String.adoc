== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/[387. First Unique Character in a String]
Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.
```c
Example 1:
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0

Example 2:
Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1
```

== Approach.
=== Logic
* Take a vector<int> dic(26) which will store frequency of characters.
```c
aabccdd
    a   b   c   d
  | 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
    0   1   2   3
  dic
```
* Iterate through input string and freq of character from dic. As freq=1 is found, return index
```c
i/p string = aabccdd
freq         221
```

=== Complexity
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n)

=== Code
==== CPP11
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int firstUniqChar(string s) {
         vector<int> dic(26, 0);
         for (char&i:s) {
             dic[i-'a']++;
         }
         for (auto it=s.begin(); it!=s.end(); it++) {
             if (dic[*it-'a'] == 1)
                return it-s.begin();
         }
         return -1;
    }
};
```
==== Rust
```rs
impl Solution {
    pub fn first_uniq_char(s: String) -> i32 {
        let mut dic:Vec<i32> = vec![0; 26];
        s.chars().for_each(|ele| {
            dic[(ele as u8 - b'a') as usize] += 1;
        });
        for (i, c) in s.chars().enumerate() {
            if dic[(c as u8 - b'a') as usize] == 1 {
                return i as i32;
            }
        }
        -1
    }
}
```
