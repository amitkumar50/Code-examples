## POP3 / Post Office Protocol, version 3 / RFC 1939
- Simpler, less secure, less number of messages wrt [IMAP](/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer5/Protocols/IMAP_Internet_Message_Access_Protocol). But still POP3 is used at some places.
- **How it works?**
  - In POP3 mails are downloaded to user agent computer as compared in SMTP/IMAP mails are downloaded to IMAP server.
  - This makes life harder for users.
  - **Disadv** Also, user agent computer crashes all email may be lost permanently.
