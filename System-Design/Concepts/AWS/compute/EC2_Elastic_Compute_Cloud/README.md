 **EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud)**
 - 

## EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud)
- This is server hosted in AWS cloud, where we can create EC2 instances(or VMs). Helpful in scaling up/down.
  - With EC2, we can spun/delete instances when needed/not needed & pay only for the compute time.
- **without EC2(Old world):** if we need an new server, 1st decide how big server is required(how many cores etc), purcharse, installation around 2+ months

| C4 | Compute Optimized | CPU Intensive AppDBs |
| G2 | Graphics Intensive | |
| H2| High speed storage | |
| F1 | Field programmable Gate Array | |
| T2 | Lowest cost general purpose | |
| P2 | Graphics/General Purpose| |
