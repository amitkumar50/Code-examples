## Full Mesh
- **What?**
  - Each branch office connects to other branch office directly.
```html
site-1 --- site-3
 |    \     |
 |      \   |
site-2 -- site-4
```
- **Disadvantages**
  - *1. Complexity of implementation*
    - Because all sites must be interconnected), they cannot scale.
  - *2. Management overhead*
