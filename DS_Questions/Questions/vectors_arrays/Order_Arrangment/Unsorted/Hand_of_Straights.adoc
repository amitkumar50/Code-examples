Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size groupSize, and consists of groupSize consecutive cards.

Given an integer array hand where hand[i] is the value written on the ith card and an integer groupSize, return true if she can rearrange the cards, or false otherwise.
```c
Example 1:
Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3
Output: true
Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]

Example 2:
Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4
Output: false
Explanation: Alice's hand can not be rearranged into groups of 4.
```

== Approach-1. 
=== Logic
* Count the card and their freq using hashmap
```c
[1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8]
<1,1> <2,2> <3,2> <4,1> <7,1> <6,1> <8,1>
```
* Store cards in min_heap<key, value>
```c
  <1,1>
  <2,2>
  <3,2>
  ..
```
* Now pop groupSized unique cards from heap.
* if min_heap gets empty in between of poping cards (return false) that means we donot have cards in factor of groupSizes

=== Complexity
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n)

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isNStraightHand(vector<int>& hand, int groupSize) {
        if (hand.size() % groupSize != 0) return false;

        // Count frequency of each card
        unordered_map<int, int> cardCount;
        for (int card : hand)
            cardCount[card]++;

        // Use a min-heap to process cards in sorted order
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap;
        for (auto& entry : cardCount) {
            minHeap.push(entry.first);
        }

        while (!minHeap.empty()) {
            int firstCard = minHeap.top();
            // Try to form a group starting with the smallest card
            for (int i = 0; i < groupSize; ++i) {
                int card = firstCard + i;
                if (cardCount[card] == 0) {
                    return false; // Can't form a consecutive group
                }
                cardCount[card]--;
                if (cardCount[card] == 0) {
                    // Remove card from heap if count is zero
                    if (card != minHeap.top()) {
                        return false; // Card out of order in the heap
                    }
                    minHeap.pop();
                }
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```
