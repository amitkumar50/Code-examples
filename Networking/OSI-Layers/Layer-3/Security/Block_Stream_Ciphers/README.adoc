== Cipher
* Cipher means encryption algorithms.

=== 1. Stream Cipher
* Does encryption on bit by bit level using key stream of bits.
```c
plaintext = abc = 0001001 00101010 00101011
key stream      = 0010010 00100101 00111110
```

==== Types of Stream Ciphers
===== Asynchronous
* key stream is independent of data.

===== Synchronous
* key stream dependents on data and key.
 
=== 2. Block Cipher / Fiestel Ciphers (Eg: AES(Rijndael))
* Break plain text into blocks of fixed length and apply encryption block by block.
==== SPN?
* Block ciphers are built using substitution-permutation network.
