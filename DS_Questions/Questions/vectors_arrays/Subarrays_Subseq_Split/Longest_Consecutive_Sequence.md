## [Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence)
- Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
- You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
- Examples
```c
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4   //The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

Input: nums = [-100, 9, 7, 5, 8, 6, 100]
Output: 6       //5,6,7,8,9
```
