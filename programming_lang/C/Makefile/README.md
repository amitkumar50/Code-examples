## Makefile

### SECTIONS IN MAKEFILE
1. **Target** Can be name of
   a. File that is generated by makefile. Examples: Object files, executables.
   b. Action to carry out, such as `clean'(Phony target)
```
target .. : dependencies ..
            command
```
2. **Dependency** File that used to as input to create target. Examples: source code file etc
3. ***Rules*** commands needed to make the target
   - Types of Rules
     a. Explicit Rules
     b. Implicit Rules
4. **Comments**     
5. **Directives**
   - include: Suspend reading current Makefile and read other makefile before continuing.
   - override: This is for setting the variable. Example: (override variable = value)
   
- Example
   - targets
      - `hello-exe` depends on 2 object files(called Dependencies)
      - `main.o` depends on 1 header and 1 source file(called Dependencies)
      - `clean` is 
```
hello-exe : main.o test.o 
        cc -o edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
                   insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
main.o : main.c defs.h                                   //target = main.o
        cc -c main.c
test.o : test.c defs.h
        cc -c test.c
clean :
        rm hello-exe main.o test.o
```

### Meanings in Makefile
- **PHONY target** not real name of a file, it is just a name for a recipe to be executed.
- **.PRECIOUS** 
  - if make is killed or interrupted during the execution of their recipes, the target is not deleted. 
  - Also, if the target is an intermediate file, it will not be deleted after it is no longer needed
  - Basically, .PRECIOUS to preserve intermediate files.
- **include** Suspend reading current Makefile and read other makefile before continuing.  
- **$(call variable,param1,param2,…)** Used for creating function(named variable) with parameters(param1,param2..)
   - Here BOOST_CHECK variable is assigned to function.
