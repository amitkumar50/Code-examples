## A. Terms
#### 1. Energy Bands
  - **What** According to band theory, the electrons in a solid can possess bands of energies called allowed bands of energies and these electrons may not possess some other bands of energies called forbidden bands of energies. 
    - *Forbidden Band/Band Gap* Band seperating valance and conduction band.
    - *Valance Band* highest range of electron energies in which electrons are present at 0 temperature. As electrons reach conduction band from valance band it leaves a hole and other electrons can move bit more freely in valance band.
    - *Conduction Band* topmost band of energy
#### 2. Electrical Conductivity
  - Depends on amount/capacity of electrons to move from valance to conduction band.
  
## B. Metal, Semiconductor, Insulator
- **Metals**
  - Valance & conduction band overlap. No band gap here.
  - At zero temperature large number of electrons remains in the conduction band.
  - Electricity can pass easily b/w them.
- **Semiconductor**
  - Partially full valence band and partially full conduction band at the room temperature.
  - These are insulators at room temp, increasing of temperature the electrical conductivity of semiconductors increase.
- **Insulator**
  - Poor conductor of electricity.

|Conduction Band|Empty| |Partially full|
|Band Gap|Largest, Crossing requires large energy| None | Less |

## C. Silicon Semiconductor
- **Why Silicon** All devices supercomputers, smart phones, air microwave ovens are made of silicon chip.
- **Why Semiconductors are used in making Electronic devices?**
  - We want devices to be switched between on/off at *ROOM TEMPRATURE*. 
    - Metal conducts electrons hence hard to turn them off.
    - insulators do not conduct electrons, so turning them on is difficult. 
    - Semiconductors are best choice.
  - Properties of Semiconductor can be altered sing **doping**(mixing impurities into element to modify its electrical properties), Silicon is doped and it starts amplfiying electrical signals and hence becomes ideal for making transistors.
- **Why Si is preferred over other semiconductors**
  - Silicon is abundant on earth's crust(8th most abundant element on earth) hence cheap.
  - Si has lower carrier mobilities (ie electrons don't move as fast per second) wrt to other semiconductors(germanium, gallium arsenide).
  - Billions of dollars and huge time spent over the several decades perfecting the process of making chips using Si. Even if another material might be better than silicon, a huge amount of time (many years!) and money (billions of dollars!) would be required to be invested again.
  - Wrt germanium Si is good at high temperatures because electron bonds are stronger in silicon than in germanium. Germanium has weaker bonds to its electrons and at high temperatures these bonds may be broken and lead to worse performance.
  - Easy to add layer of insulator over silicon and easy to create MOSFET/transistor devices.
