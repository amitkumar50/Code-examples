== Graph
Collection of nodes/vertices with edges between some/all of them. Examples: Internet, City map, Person's Social Network, State machines.
```c
    0 ------- 1     4         //Nodes: 0,1,2,3,4,5
    |         |               //Edges ={01, 12, 23, 03}
    3 ------- 2     5
```

== Representation of Graph
=== 1. Adjacency List	//Often used
- Each node keeps list of adjacent neighbours.
- Data structures can be vectors, ll etc. Advantages: Save space, only stores connected nodes.
```c
    3 -- 1
    | \
    |   \
    0 -- 2

        2,3   3    0,3   0,1,2  <Linked list
	/\    /\    /\    /\
        |     |     |     |
Nodes | 0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  <vector

      |key value   |           |             |               |
      | 0 | [2,3]  |  1 | [3]  |  2 | [0,3]  |  3 | [0,1,2]  |  <<HashTable
      |            |           |             |               |
```
=== 2. Edge List
- Each node keeps [edges](#t)
```cpp
    3 -- 1
    | \
    |   \
    0 -- 2

   v[0] |2|3|		//0 has edges to 2,3
   v[1] |3|		//1 has edge to 3
   v[2] |0|3|           //2 has edges to 0,3
   v[3] |0|1|2|         //3 has edges to 0,1,2

  v[0].push_back(2); v[0].push_back(3);
  v[1].push_back(3); v[2].push_back(3);
```
=== 3. Adjacency Matrix/Lookup table/2D Matrix
- Shows whether node has connection to other node or not. `0 means No, 1 means yes`
- For weighted graph values are cost/weights.
- *Advantages* Easy to represent, Removing an edge takes O(1) time, Queries like whether there is an edge from vertex `u` to vertex `v` takes O(1)
```c
    3 -- 1
    | \
    |   \
    0 -- 2
    
   0   1   2   3
0  0   0   1   1    
1  0   0   0   1
2  1   0   0   1
3  1   1   1   0
```

== Terms
=== Degree
- _Undirected Graph:_ Number of edges incident on it.
- _Directed Graph:_ 
  - _Indegree of Node:_ Number of edges leading into that node.
  - _Outdegree:_ the number of edges leading away from node.

=== Diameter/Eccentricity
Greatest distance between any pair of vertices.

=== Edge/Arc/Line
Links connecting the nodes. Links can be directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted. Weight also means cost.

=== Radius 
Minimum eccentricity of any vertex.

=== Vertex = Node
Interconnected objects are called vertices.

=== Connected Components?
This is subgraph in which each pair of nodes is connected with each other via a path. Here 3

```

== Types of Graphs
=== 1. Cyclic/Acyclic
- *Cyclic:* If graph has cycle.  
- *Acyclic:* No cycles in graph. When following the graph from node to node, you will never visit the same node twice.

==== 1a. DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph)
- Directed graph without cycles graph. DAG will surely have 1 vertex with indegree=0 and 1 vertex with outdegree=0, because it does not have cycle.
```c
    a  ---->  b        //In-degree: Number of edges coming to the vertex. Eg: in-degree for c is 2
    |        \/        //Out-degree: Number of edges going out of vertex. Eg: out-degree for a is 2
    ------->  c
```
- **Search Complexity** 
  - Average case O(V+E). V=vertices, E=Edges
  - Best case. O(logE). Using DFS, two parallel tree traversals, one preorder traversal and other postorder traversal.

=== 3. Spanning Tree
* Subgraph derived from Graph satisfying these conditions:
** No cycles(ie it is acyclic), Since it a tree
** Should connect all vertices with minimum number of edges.

* *Properties of ST*
1. graph can have many spanning trees.
2. Graph can be weighted or unweighted. Every connected and undirected Graph G has at least 1 ST.
3. A disconnected graph does not have any ST, as it cannot be spanned to all its vertices.
4. Number of Spanning Trees, for graph having `n` vertices = n<sup>n-2</sup>
5. Number of edges, for graph having `n` vertices = n - 1
```c
Example
    a ------ b               a ----- b              a ------ b           a --- b
    |    /   |                       |              |                      \
    |   /    |               c ----- d              c ------ d               \
    c  ----- d                                                           c --- d
    Main Graph                1 ST                  Another ST          Another ST
```
* *Applications of ST
1. Civil Network Planning: City network as a huge graph and now plans to deploy telephone lines in such a way that in minimum lines we can connect to all city nodes.    
2. Computer Network Routing Protocol

==== 3a. Min Spanning Tree
A ST where total weight of all edges is minimum. Has n-1 edges.

* *Finding Min Spanning Tree?*
* Start from min weight edge > Go on connecting all min weight edges. > Donot connect any edge that creates a cycle. We cannot connect cb.
 ```c
    a --5-- b                         b               b       a        
   3|   /4  |3                        |3              |3     3|         
    c --1-- d        c --1-- d        c --1-- d       c --1-- d                                    
```
* *Algorithms for finding Min Spanning Tree*
```c
             Algo | Kruskal's  | Prim's
  --------------- |----------- | -------
  Time Complexity | O(E log V) | O(E + V log V) //slow 
  When to use     |            | Works faster in graph with many more edges than vertices 
```
* *A. PRIM's Algorithm*  
* Time Complexity = O(E + V log V) //slow wrt kruskal's
* Choose arbitrary vertex to start > Choose min weight edge that is not in(output mst), note that in mst > Repeat step-2 until all edges are in mst.

```

=== 4. Weighted/Unweighted Graph
* Weighted? If edges has cost/weight. Ex: flight fuel cost between cities.        
* Unweighted? if the edges do not have weights.
```c
   0 --50-- 1
 10|        |20
   3 --50-- 2
```

== Operations
=== Disjoint set Union
Some applications involve grouping n distinct elements/nodes into a collection of disjoint sets. These applications often need to perform two operations: 
  - Finding the unique set that contains a given element OR
  - uniting two sets. 

_Datastructure:_ disjoint-set data structure maintains a collection S = {S1,S2,S3 ..} of disjoint dynamic sets. Each set has a REPRESENTATIVE element(which is member of set).

_Operations:_ 
  - UNION(x, y): unites the dynamic sets that contain x and y, say Sx and Sy, into a new set that is the union of these two sets.
  - FIND-SET(x): returns a pointer to the representative of the (unique) set containing x.

==== Application. link:[Connected Component in Graph]
> When the edges of the graph are static(not changing over timeâ€”we) can compute the connected components faster by using depth-first search.

4 Connected components in graph.

Vertices(V) = a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j
