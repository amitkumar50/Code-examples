## ACPI(Advanced Configuration and Power Interface)
- This is Open standard using which Operating system can:
  1. Discover & configure Hardware components
  2. Perform power management. This brings power management under OS control. (Eg: putting unused components on sleep)
  3. Perform status monitoring
- ACPI replaces APM & PnP specifications.
- How it works?
 - ACPI advertises available components to OS kernel using methods provided thru [firmware(UEFI or BIOS)](https://github.com/amitkumar50/Code-examples/blob/master/cpu_memory_thread_process/CPU/firmware_UEFI.md)

## 1. Processor Power Management Technologies
- ACPI divided power management technologies into 2 categories.

### 1.1 P-State(Power performance/Processing states)?
 **What** 
  - This is a map <voltage,frequency> pairs based on which speed and power consumption of the [coprocessor](https://github.com/amitkumar50/Code-examples/blob/master/cpu_memory_thread_process/CPU/processor_coprocessor.md) is decided.
  - Provides way to scale Frequency & voltage on which processor is running, with aim of reducing power consumption.
  -  The coprocessor's PM SW(status word) handles the transition from one P-state to another
 **Goal** 
  - Reducing Power Consumption Without Impacting Performance
**Frequency to battery relation**  
 - High Frequency -> high CPU I/O Rate -> High Processor performance -> high battery consumption
 - Reduced frequency to 1/2 -> CPU I/O Rate is reduced to 1/2 -> performance 1/2ed -> less battery consumption
 - PC-States(Core P states):

#### Power consumption
P ~ f VÂ²	//f=frequency, V=voltage

### 1.2 C-State(Processor Idle state)
- **What** State in which CPU is at idle or turned off certain functions.
#### Types of C-States
- CC-States(Core C states): 1 CPU have multipe cores. This is C state of core.
- C0(active): Everything is powered on, processor executing code. P-state is relevant here.
- C1(Halt): Nothing is executing. Any P-state is not relevant here.
- C2(Stop-Clock): similar to C1 but it takes longer time to go back to C0
- C3(Sleep): will take considerably longer time to go to C0.
- ..
- C8

### 1.3 T-State(Throttling State)
- **What** This was old state existed before C,P States. This use to save processor from burning down.
- **How it worked?** 
  - when things went very bad, such as when the cooling fan failed while the processor was running at max. Temperature sensor senses the junction temperature was reaching a level that could cause damage the processor, the HW power manager would place the processor in different T-States depending upon temperature.
  - The normal run state of the processor was T0.
- **How its different from P, C States?**
  - Note that in contrast to P-states, the voltage and frequency are not changed. 
  - In T-states the application runs slower not because the processor is running slower, but because application is suspended for some percent of the time.
