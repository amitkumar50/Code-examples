## chroot
- chroot changes the root directory. Every process/command in Linux has root directory. It changes the root directory for currently running processes as well as its child processes.
- A process/command that runs in such a modified environment cannot access files outside the root directory. This modified environment is known as “chroot jail” or “jailed directory”. Some root user and privileged process are allowed to use chroot command
