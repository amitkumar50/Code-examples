## Number System
- Technique to represent numbers in the computer system architecture, every value that you are saving or getting into/from computer memory has a defined number system.

## Types of Number Systems
- **1. BINARY(BASE 2):** 
  - This has only 2 digits(0, 1). Every number is represented using 0 and 1. Base of binary number system is 2, because it has only two digits.
- **2. OCTAL(BASE 8):**
  - Has 8 digits(0 to 7). Every number represents with 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 in this number system. Base of octal number system is 8, because it has only 8 digits.
- **3. DECIMAL(BASE 10):**
  - Has only 10 digits(0 to 9). Every number represents with 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, 7,8 and 9 in this number system. The base of decimal number system is 10, because it has only 10 digits. Most popular since we have 10 fingers.
- **4. HEXADECIMAL(BASE 16):** 
  - Has (16) alphanumeric values (0-9 & A-F). Every number represents with 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, 7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E, F in this number system. 
- **5. BASE 62 NUMBER SYSTEM:** 
  - Has 62 values (a-z,A-Z,0-9) to represent a number.
- **6. BASE 256:** 
  - ASCII chart defines 256 different letters alltogether.
