### A. PCI(Peripheral Component Interconnect)
- A standard that describes how to connect the peripheral components/devices of a system together in a structured and controlled way.
  
### B. PCI-Bridges
- These are used to connect more than 1 PCI bus to the system. Bridges joins the PCI buses.

### C. PCI Bus Architecture
- Overall layout of a PCI system is a tree where each bus is connected to an upper-layer bus, up to bus 0 at the root of the tree.

### D. Peripheral/PCI Device
- **What?** Device used to put/get information into/from computer eg: I/O devices. Devices that is connected to PCI Bus.
- **PCI Device Examples?**  *Input*:Mouse,keyboard,webcam  *Output*: Monitor,printer,headphones *I/O*: Network cards, Bus controllers USB, PCMCIA, Sound cards, Graphics cards
- **PCI Device types**
  1. *End point device(Type 0)* That does not spawn another bus behind it. Example: VGA, LAN card
  2. *Bridge Device(Type-1)* Which can spawn another bus behind it.
- **PCI Device Representation  Bus:Device:Function**
  - Each PCI device is represented using: 
    - *Bus No* Bus on which PCI device is connected
    - *Device Number (5 bit)* Each device is given a number by vendor.
    - *Function number(3 bit)* Each device can have upto 8 functions.
- **Listing all PCI devices on system**

- **[PCI Registers / PCI Configuration Space](PCIConfigSpace.md)**
  - **What** PCI Devices can be read/written/configured using PCI configuration space registers.

| | PCI | PCIe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Register length | 256 bytes | 4096 bytes |


### Communication b/w CPU & PCI Device
#### Method-1 MMIO(Memory Mapped IO)
- At system boot, kernel send/recv messages with each PCI-device & **MAPS PCI-device control registers(PCI Config Space registers)** are mapped into the address space of the processor, this address space is called MCFG-SPACE(256 MB). 
- When device driver accesses the PCI device, its memory and I/O regions have already been mapped into the processorâ€™s address space. Details [PCIConfigSpace.md](PCIConfigSpace.md)
#### Method-2 (Special I/O instructions)

### B. Peripheral Circuit Board(PCB)?
- **What** Boards of peripheral devices. PCB has 8 pins out of which 4 are for interrupts. Eg: dvr, printer, external modem, game console etc.  
- **Response PCI provides to CPU?** PCB provides only these 3 addresses to CPU: 
  - Configuration Registers (also called **config space**	{Section-C})
  - memory locations
  - I/O ports
