## Microprocessor	vs MicroController

||Microprocessor|MicroController|
|---|---|---|
|What| IC having only CPU(multicore)|CPU+RAM+ROM on Single chip|
|Why||Perform specific tasks, where Input,output are defined|
|Examples||keyboards, mouse, washing machine, mobiles, watches|
|Clock Speed|Above 1GHz|30-50 MHz|

## I2C(Inter-Integrated Circuit)
- **What?**  Multi-master, Multi-slave, packet switched, single-ended, serial communication bus.
- **Why?** Used for attaching ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance
