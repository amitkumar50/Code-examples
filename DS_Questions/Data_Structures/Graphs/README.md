## Graph
- **What?** Collection of nodes/vertices with edges between some/all of them. Examples: Internet, City map, Person's Social Network, State machines. [Representation of Graphs: Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List, Edge List](Representation)
```c
    0 ------- 1     4         //Nodes: 0,1,2,3,4,5
    |         |               //Edges ={01, 12, 23, 03}
    3 ------- 2     5
```
