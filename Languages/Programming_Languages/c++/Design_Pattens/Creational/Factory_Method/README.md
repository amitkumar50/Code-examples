## 1. Factory Method DP
- This is to hide the logic of object creation.
- Replace direct object construction calls (using the new operator) with calls to a special factory method. 
- At RUNTIME, user/caller is not bothered about object creation Logic it just calls FACTORYMETHOD and required Object is returned.
