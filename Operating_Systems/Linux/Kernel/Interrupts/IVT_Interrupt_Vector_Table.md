## IVT(Interrupt Vector Table)
- Contains ISR(Interrupt service routine)/Handler/Address to which CPU jumps at occurrence of interrupt. present in 1st 1K of physical memory.
- IVT is filled using [Probing](Probing_Hardware_Device.md).
- Interrupt number is used as index in IVT. CPU goes to IVT's index, gets Program counter and starts Interrupt service procedure. Once CPU starts ISP, Device Acks Interrupt controller
```c
            | 0x420932 ISR of Int0 |      |     |     |
Interrupt No>       0                 1       2     3

    CPU                    Hardware_Device
       <- Interrupt3=signal-
 Find & runs ISR3 for Intr3
    isr3(){..}
```
