## EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud)
  - **What**
    - a web service that provider re-sizable compute capacity in the cloud
    - With EC2, you can boot ***new server*** in 2 minutes.
    - It means you to quickly scale up or down, as your computing requirement change.
    - You only need to pay for the capacity that you actually use.
    - several tools are provided for resilient and isolate from failure scenarios
  - **without EC2(Old world)**
    - if you needed an new server(app server, db server etc).
    - 1st need to write how big server is required, how many cores, purcharse, installation -> 2 months
