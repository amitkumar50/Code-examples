## Reliable 
- TCP recovers lost, duplicated, corrupted packets.
- **How it works?**
  - *Sender* TCP provides Seq no to every packet. Sends the packet. Expects its ACK within timer, If does not receives, re transmits
  - *Receiver* Arranges all TCP segments using seq no, knows about duplicate or lost packets
- **How Duplicate packets are generated?**
  - *a.* If a sending host thinks a packet is not transmitted correctly because of a PacketLoss, it might Retransmit that packet. The receiving host might already got the first packet, and will receive a second one, which is a duplicated packet
  - *b.* Sometimes defective Hardware/Software also generates the duplicate packets.
- **How TCP Handles Duplicates?**
  - ConnectionOrientedProtocols such as TCP will detect duplicate packets, and will ignore them completely.
  - ConnectionlessProtocols such as UDP won't detect duplicate packets.
