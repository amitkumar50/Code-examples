## Terms

- **Antisnubbing:** snub means ignoring someone or something. Time to time, a BitTorrent peer becomes choked/blocked by all peers from which it was receiving fragments because of poor download/upload capacity or absesnce of required fragments. 
  - *Solution:* Finds a better peer than any of the current ones.
- **[Availability](Availability)**
- **Bandwidth:** Theoritical maximum at which data can be tranferred over link. Practical is Throughput. 
  - *Bandwidth Throttling:* Intentional slowing or speeding of an internet service by an Internet service provider (ISP). 
    - *Advantages?* To reduce bandwidth congestion, To reduce a user's usage of bandwidth.
- **Biased Neighbour Selection?** BitTorrent peer chooses most of its neighbors from the local ISP and only a few peers from other ISPs reducing traffic, this is assisted by [Tracker](/System-Design/Scalable/Distributed_Downloading_Systems/BitTorrent/Terms.md). 
  - Tracker sends 35-k times peers from same ISP. Tracker uses Internet topology maps in autonomous system (AS) mappings to identify ISP boundaries.
- **[Bootstraping?](Bootstraping)** How new node enters into network(Basically Distributed File sharing network).
- **Broker,Super Peers:** As part of middleware layer, broker/super peer will facilitate communication b/w nodes(Weak peers). Super peer can attach to other super peer for replication. Weak peer can attach to another better super peer.
- **[Consistency / Accuracy](Consistency)**
- **[CAP Theorem](CAP_Theorem)**
- **Deduplication:** Eliminating duplicate or redundant information. Eg: How server identifies and drops duplicate packet when recieved.
- **End Game / End Mode:** To download all end fragments, Bittorrent client sends requests to all of its peers. As soon client gets the ending fragment it sends cancel to peers.
- **[Flash Crowd](FLash_Crowd)**
- **Flooding:** Searching method in distributed enviornment. Node-1 floods data to be searched to all connected nodes. Generates Huge traffic. To mitigate traffic, TTL can be used.
- **Free Riding:** Having selfish peers who do not contribute to the [swarm](/System-Design/Scalable/Distributed_Downloading_Systems/BitTorrent/Terms.md) just wanted to take file from swarm.
  - *Solution* Node will only send packet to that whose is in his [Neighbour set(NS)](/System-Design/Scalable/Distributed_Downloading_Systems/BitTorrent/Terms.md)
    - Example: Swarm=User-2...User-10. User-1 decides to connect user-2 for file. Now User-2 will only send file to user-1 when user-1 is in swarm downloaded from Tracker server. It means User-1 is also sending fragments.
- **Latency:** Measured as a round trip time ie time taken for packet to reach dest and ACK to come to source again.
- **Local Rarest First for Piece Selection**
  - Nodes independently maintains a list of the fragments which are least number of copies amongst [swarm](/System-Design/Scalable/Distributed_Downloading_Systems/BitTorrent/Terms.md). Whenever a new client joins in, he is given this list and he starts downloading the rarest fragment.
- **Mutation?** Writing data from client to server's memory/disk. Specifically mutation is an operation that changes the contents or metadata of a data. Example: Write, append in distributed file system is a mutation.
  - _Long Mutation:_ Not changing the data set longer time. Keeping data persistant for longer time.
- **Optimistic Unchoking:** Unselfishly provide block(s) to node(s) in Neighbour set.
  - Node uses a part of its available bandwidth for sending data to random peers, so that neighbours donot fall in tit for tat problem.
- **Partition Tolerance:** The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures
- **Path Folding / Location Swapping:** During routing(finding route to node which has data), its important to find shortest/least cost path for scalability and efficiency.
  - *Disadvantage:* Man In Middle can advertise route to destination, get connected and perform attacks.
- **Policy Based Search:** Node keeps track of neighbours who responded positively & sends request to them again
- **Random Walk?** Node selects k neighbours randomly, sends key-100(data to searched) to them, again those neighbours selects k neighbours.
- **Throughput:**
  - Rate of successful message delivery over a communication channel(Ethernet, wifi etc).
  - Measured in Bits/sec(bps), data packets per second (p/s or pps).
- **Tit for Tat Strategy:**  if the node-1 was cooperative, then node-2 is also cooperative. if node-1 is not cooperative then node-2 is also not.
