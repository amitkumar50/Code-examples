# IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)
## What
- Host reports their multicast groups to adjacent routers on **IPv4 networks** to establish **multicast group memberships**.
- Host and router both should be on same LAN.
- Protocol no:2
- TTL: 1 (Means IGMP Host is directly connected to IGMP Router)
- Multicast management on **IPv6 networks** is handled by **Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD)** which is a part of ICMPv6.
