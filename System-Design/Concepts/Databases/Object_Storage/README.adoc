==== ODMG/Object Data Management Group

== How Object Store (should) be storing data?
```c
  hashmap  <key=video_id, value = vector<meta_data_virtual_address, video_file_virtual_address>>
  
  |Video_id     |Virtual Address of Video File in Memory|
  |-------------|---------------------------------------|
  | 2412as      |           0x004                       |
  | aw1as2      |           0x505                       |       

// Similar for photos
```

== Examples of Object Store
=== Amazon S3(Simple Storage Service)
S3 stores everything in buckets. each bucket can have 100's of objects. Example: There is 1 large Video, We will store Video chunks on S3.
```c
  <key=bucket-id, Value=Video_url(or video)>
      11, xyz
      12, abc
      ..
```

* *S3 Storage classes*
|===
|Class|What

|1. S3|Durable, immediately available and frequently accessed
|2. S3-IA(Infrequently accessed)|For data that is accessed less frequently
|3. S3 â€“ RRS (Reduced Redundancy Storage)| Less durable with availabilty. Used for data that is easily reproducible, such thumbnails
