Round-1(Telephonic):
 a. Sum of consecutive elements of array to be stored in same array.
	input: 9999
	output 1818 

Round-2(Skype):
  1. move vs copy ctr
    - Use cases of move?
    - Things to consider while moving?
    - Do we need to do memory NULL after move?
  2. How virtual table works?
  3. Linked List Questions(write code).
    a. Detecting loop?
    b. Finding intersection of 2 LL?

Round-3(Technical):
1. Implementing shared pointer class using templates
2. Does constructor return a value? if not how return *this can be called?
3. lambda function.
	- If we donnot specify anything in capture list, can we use global vairables inside lambda.
4. Does #include<header-file> is equal to copying and pasting the whole content?
5. Binay maze problem. Go from (0,0) to (5,5) and print if path exists or not?
6. write a copy constructor
7. Will it work or crash?
int main(){
	int *p;
	*p=20;
}
8. why lambda function is required?
9. What is "extern c" in C++, why its required? What is name mangling?
