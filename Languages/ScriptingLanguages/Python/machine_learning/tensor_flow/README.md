- **Tensor?**
  - Multi-dimensional arrays used to store numbers during computation.
  - String tensors donâ€™t exist in Numpy (or in most other libraries), because tensors are preallocated contiguous memory segments, and strings, being variable length. 

## TENSORFLOW(by google)
- This is ML Open source library(EXPOSING APIs) for numerical computation and large-scale ML supports CPUs & GPUs. 
- Python Front-end APIs & backend written in c++ for high performance.
