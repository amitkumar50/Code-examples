## Administrative Scalability
- Multiple, independent administrative domains having conflicting policies for resource usage, payment management and security.
- **Example:** A computational(often expensive) equipment is segregated as [Federation](/System-Design/Concepts/Databases/Database_Scaling) where Program_1(Orgnization_1) can access resources of DB_2(Organization_2).
