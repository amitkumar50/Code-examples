## Cloud
Running programs on someone else's cluster of computers.
#### Types of cloud
- _1. Private_: used by specific orgnizations.
- _2. Public:_ Used by general public.
- _3. Community:_ Used by specific community
- _4. Hybrid:_ Composed of 2 or more different clouds.

## Distributed System
Collection of computing elements that appears to its users as a 1 system giving 1 system view ie end users does not notice that he is dealing with processes, data and control are dispersed across the nodes.
- All transactions in distributed systems Follow ACID(Atomic, Consistency, Isolated, Durable)
- **Components of DS**
  - *1. Middleware* It hides he differences in H/W and OS from each application.  
  - *2. Broker* All application commnicate with each other using broker.

#### Architecture of Distributed Systems
- *1. Layered:* Components are organized in a layered fashion making upcall/downcall. Eg: TCP-IP Stack
- _2. Object Based/SOA:_ Each object/Node is connected using Procedure call mechanism. Client machine have proxy/stub application running which communicates with Server running on other machine.
- _3. Resource Centered/REST:_ Node/Resource is identified by single naming scheme. All services provide same interface. Stateless, no state maintained.
- _4. Event Based/Publisher Subscriber:_ Process1 publishes a notification describing the occurrence of an event. Process2 subscribed to kind of notification gets the message.

#### Types of Distributed Systems
1. High Performance Distributed Computing
2. Cluster Computing: Simple computers connected on high-speed network, does parallel processing of task. Eg: Hadoop.
3. Grid Computing: Nodes can be anything. Databases, High end machines(super computers), normal processor, sensors, telescopes etc.
4. Cloud Computing: Customer upload tasks to a data center and charged on a per-resource basis. 3 types of services to customers.

  -----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------
  A. IaaS(Infrastructure as Service) | Provide VM. Cloud provider will give access to OS of server/VM,           | GCE(google compute Engine)
                                       user can install/remove/do anything on Server. Highest control.           |
  B. PaaS(Platform as Service)       | Provide Dashboard. upload button is provided you can upload your website. | GAE(Google App engine)
                                       Write your code, Cloud provider will take care of it                      |
  C. SaaS(Software as Service)       | Host S/W on cloud VM. SaaS is accessed using a thin client or by browser  | 
     or On-Demand Service            
  D. CaaS(Container as a Service)    | Creating kubernets clusters.                                              | GKE(Google Kubernets Engine)
  E. FaaS(Function as a Service)     | Writing application for IoT, mobilr backends.
     or Cloud Functions
  F. Managed Services
