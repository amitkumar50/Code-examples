## PCI system Architecture
  - [PCI Devices](Terms/PCI_Device) can be plugged on PCI slots present on mother board and connected to CPU using PCI-Buses, buses are connected using [PCI-Bridges](Terms/PCI_Bridge).
  - Layout of a PCI system is a tree where each bus is connected to an upper-layer bus, up to bus 0 at the root of the tree.

### Communication b/w CPU & PCI Device
- **Method-1 MMIO(Memory Mapped IO)**
  - At system boot, kernel send/recv messages with each PCI-device & maps PCI-device control registers([PCI Config Space registers](Terms/PCI_Config_Space)) into the address space of the processor, this address space is called MCFG-SPACE(256 MB).
  - When device driver accesses the PCI device, its memory and I/O regions have already been mapped into the processorâ€™s address space.
- **Method-2 (Special I/O instructions)**
