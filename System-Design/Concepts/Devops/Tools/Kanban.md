# kanban(tool for implementing devops)
- **What**
  - Kanban method encourages continuous, incremental, and evolutionary changes to your current system.
  - Supply is determined according to the actual demand, not according to some theoretical value.
  
# Kanban Theories
- **1. Theory of constraints (TOC)** A chain is no stronger than its weakest link. 
  - Means weakest items in the overall chain can cause failure or adversely affect the outcome.
- **2. Kaizen** means continuous improvement.

# Kanban Properties
### 1. Visualize the Workflow 
- How work is done/related is inherently invisible. Visualizing the flow of work.
  - Method: Use a sticker/card wall with cards and columns.
### 2. Limit WIP(work in progress)
- Pull system is implemented on parts or all of the workflow. Each state in the workflow is limited.
### 3. Manage Flow
- flow of work through each state is monitored, measured, and reported.
### 4. Make Process Policies Explicit
- Process should be explained throughly to everyone to discuss problems & gain feedback.
### 5. Improve Collaboratively
- If teams have a shared understanding of theories about work, workflow, process, and risk they can solve problem more quickly.
