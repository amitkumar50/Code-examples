## CDN(Content delivery network)
- **What?** This is Web hosting service, It hosts web pages across multiple servers on multiple sites near to client machines. Hosted documents are replicated across servers. 
- **What actually CDN stores?** 
  - Each Web document(main HTML file) consists of several other embedded documents(Eg: images, video and audio etc) which donot change often. These should be cached.
  - These embedded documents are accessed using [URLs](/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer5/Protocols/README.md)
