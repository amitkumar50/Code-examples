== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/redistribute-characters-to-make-all-strings-equal/[1897. Redistribute Characters to Make All Strings Equal]
You are given an array of strings words (0-indexed).

In one operation, pick two distinct indices i and j, where words[i] is a non-empty string, and move any character from words[i] to any position in words[j].

Return true if you can make every string in words equal using any number of operations, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
```c
Input: words = ["abc","aabc","bc"]
Output: true
Explanation: 
Move the first 'a' in words[1] to the front of words[2], to make words[1] = "abc" and words[2] = "abc".
All the strings are now equal to "abc", so return true.
```

== Approach-1. Count Characters. O(n)
=== Logic
* Take unordered_map, count all characters from all strings.
* Number of characters should be absolutely divisible by number of words, then only we can redistristribute equally

=== Complexity
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n)

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool makeEqual(vector<string>& words) {
        unordered_map<char, int> um;
        int size = words.size();
        for_each(words.begin(), words.end(), [&um](string& word){
            for(char& ch: word)
                um[ch]++;
        });
        for (auto ele : um) {
            if (ele.second % size != 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
