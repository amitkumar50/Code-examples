## Docker Networking
- **What?** Connecting docker containers with each other and with outside world as well.
- **How?** Dockerâ€™s networking subsystem is pluggable using drivers forming networks.

|Network|Description|
|---|---|
|1.Bridge|This is default network driver. Used when multiple containers want to communicate on the **same Docker host**.|
|2.Host|Use [Host Networking]() directly|
|3.Overlay|Containers running on **different Docker hosts** want to communicate OR when multiple applications work together using [swarm services]().|
|4.macvlan|Assign a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device|
|5.None|disable all networking. This is not available for swarm services.|
|6.Network Plugins|integrate Docker with specialized network stacks/3rd party stacks.|
