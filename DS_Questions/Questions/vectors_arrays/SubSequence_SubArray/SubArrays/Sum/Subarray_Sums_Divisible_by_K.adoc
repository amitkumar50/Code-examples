Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of non-empty subarrays that have a sum divisible by k.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
```c
Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,0,-2,-3,1], k = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 7 subarrays with a sum divisible by k = 5:
[4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1], [5], [5, 0], [5, 0, -2, -3], [0], [0, -2, -3], [-2, -3]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [5], k = 9
Output: 0
```

== Approach-1
=== Logic
* Calculate the prefix sum. prefix sum=sum upto that index
```c
arr       =   [4,5,0,-2,-3,1]
prefixSum =   [4,9,9, 7, 4,5]
```
* Divide every prefixsum by k
```c
prefixSum =   [4,9,9, 7, 4,5]
               0 1 2  3  4 5
rem=ele%k     [4,4,4, 2, 4,0]
```
* if 2 remainders are same it means Difference of their Sums is divisible by k
```c
  rem[0] == rem[1].         //means prefixsum[1] - prefixsum[0] is divisible by 5. ie We found 1 subarray divisible by 5
  rem[2] == rem[0], rem[1]  //means prefixsum[2] - prefixsum[0] is divisible by 5. ie We found 1 subarray divisible by 5
                            //means prefixsum[2] - prefixsum[1] is divisible by 5. ie We found 2 subarrays divisible by 5
```

=== Complexity
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n)

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int subarraysDivByK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        
    int sum=0;
    int count=0;
    map<int,int>mp;
    mp[0]++;                  // always one prefix sum that is initially 0

    
    for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++)
    {
        sum+=nums[i];
        int rem=sum%k;        //Calculte the remainders of current sun
        
        if(rem<0)             // Handle negative remainders to ensure they are positive
        {
            rem=k+rem;
        }
        
        if(mp[rem]>0)          // If remainder has seen before, it means there are subarrays
            count+=mp[rem];    // which sum to multiple of k. Add the count of occurrences

        mp[rem]++;              // Increment the count for this remainder in the map
    }
    return count;
        
    }
};
```
