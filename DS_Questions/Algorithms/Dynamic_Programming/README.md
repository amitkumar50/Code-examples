## Dynamic Programming / Tabular Method
- **Applicable?**
  - When subproblems is calculated again & again  ie when Recursive solution solves the same subproblems repeatedly. Eg: Fibonacci series
- **How?**
  - DP algorithm solves each subproblem just once and then saves its answer in a table, thereby avoiding the work of recomputing the answer every time.
  - Recursion Time Complexity: Exponential, DP Time Complexity: Polynomial
- **Identifying this problem can be solved using DP?** 2 main properties of a problem that suggests that the given problem can be solved using DP.
  - _1. Overlapping Subproblems_
    - When recursive algorithm for the problem solves the same subproblems over and over again, we say that the optimization problem has overlapping subproblems.
  - _2. Optimal Substructure_
- **Methods of DP?**
  - _1. Top Down / Memoization:_
    - We write the procedure recursively in a natural manner.
    - But saves the result of each subproblem (usually in an array or hash table).
    - Now first checks to see whether it has previously solved this subproblem
    - If solved, return the saved value, saving further computation at this level
  - _2. Bottom up:_
    - Sort subproblems by size and solve them in size order, smallest first.
    - Save solutions of subproblems and refer before recalculating same as Top Down.
