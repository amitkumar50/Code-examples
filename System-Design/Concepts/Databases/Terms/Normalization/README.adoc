== Normalization?
* What? Design DB such that data redundancy and dependency are minimum.
* How achieved? Divide large tables into smaller tables and defining relationships between them

== Normalization forms
|=== 
|Form|Meaning

|1NF(1st Normal Form)|Each column in a table must contain atomic (indivisible) values. No repeating values
|2NF(2nd Normal Form)|Table must be in 1NF. All <<ffd, non-key attributes must be fully functionally dependent on the primary key>>
|3NF(3rd Normal Form)|Table must be in 2NF. No transitive dependencies, meaning that non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes
|Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)|More stringent form of 3NF. Every determinant must be a candidate key
|4NF(4th Normal Form)|Addresses situations where one non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute, independent of the primary key
|5NF(5th Normal Form)|Addresses cases where a table has a composite key, and some non-trivial join dependencies exist between the columns

== Terms
=== 1. Non-key attributes must be fully functionally dependent on the primary key
* Table: Stating course taken by student
```
| StudentID (Primary Key) | CourseID (Primary Key) | StudentName | CourseName | Professor |
```
* Primary key = student-id + course-id
* Fully Functional Dependent Attribute: Value of that attribute is determined solely by the entire primary key, and not by a subset of the key
```c
Non-key attribute (StudentName)
- should be uniquely determined by the combination of StudentID and CourseID, not just by StudentID alone or CourseID alone.

Non-key attribute (CourseName)
- The course name (CourseName) should be uniquely determined by the combination of StudentID and CourseID.
```
