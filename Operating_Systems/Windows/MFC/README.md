### Messages
Every MFC application is event driven. All application consists of message handler functions. Message is represented using this structure.
```c
struct {
  hwnd;             //window whose Handler received the message (hwnd is a pointer that contains the windowâ€™s address)
  struct message{   //Messages are represented with WM_
    type;
    number;         //Every message is defined by constant in windows.h
    wParam;         //Extra parameters in message
    IParam;         //Additional information about message
    time;           //time at which message was generated
  }
  
};
```
