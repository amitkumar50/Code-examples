You are given two linked lists: list1 and list2 of sizes n and m respectively.

Remove list1's nodes from the ath node to the bth node, and put list2 in their place.

The blue edges and nodes in the following figure indicate the result:

```
Input: list1 = [10,1,13,6,9,5], a = 3, b = 4, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002]
Output: [10,1,13,1000000,1000001,1000002,5]
Explanation: We remove the nodes 3 and 4 and put the entire list2 in their place. The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: list1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6], a = 2, b = 5, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004]
Output: [0,1,1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004,6]
Explanation: The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.

== Approach. O(n). Traverse and Replace
=== Logic
* Maintain a count variable, point p1, p2 to 1st and 2nd node
```c
a = 3, b = 4
count = 1
 10  1  13  6  9  5
 |   |
 p1  p2
```
* Keep incrementing count and move p1,p2 until count == a
```c
a = 3, b = 4
count = 2
 10  1  13  6  9  5
     |   |
    p1  p2

count = 3
 10  1  13  6  9  5
        |   |
       p1  p2
```
* When (count == a), point p1 to list1
```c
count = 3
 10  1  13  6  9  5
        |   |
       p1  p2
```
