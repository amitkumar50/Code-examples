- Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.
* *Always Do as per REQUIREMENT*
** Solution should be better than O(n log n). Can you do it in linear time O(n) and possibly in a single pass?
** Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like __builtin_popcount in C++)?
```c
Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
```

=== Approach-1. O(nlogn)  //But Requirement is O(n)

=== Approach-2. O(n*32). Bitwise & with 1 //But Requirement is O(n)
==== Logic
* Take 1, left shift perform & and count.

==== Code
===== CPP
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int FindOnes(int a){
        int i = 1, k = 1;
        int ones = 0;
        while (k++ != sizeof(int)*8) {
            if (a & i)
                ones++;
            i = i<<1;
        }
        return ones;
    }
    vector<int> countBits(int n) {
        vector<int> vecOut;
        for (int i=0;i<n+1;++i){
            vecOut.push_back(FindOnes(i));
        }
        return vecOut;
    }
};
```

===== Rust
```rs
use std::mem;
impl Solution {
    pub fn count_bits(a: i32) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut v = vec![0; (a as usize)+1];
    let mut ones:i32 = 0;
    let mut i:i32 = 1;
    let mut k:i32 = 1;

    for var in 1..a+1 {
        while k as usize != mem::size_of::<i32>()*8 {
            if var & i > 0 {
                ones += 1;
            }
            i = i << 1;
            k += 1;
        }
        v[var as usize] = ones;
        ones = 0;   
        i=1;
        k=1;
    }
    v
    }
}
```

=== Approach-3. O(n)  //But Requirement is O(n)
