## SAML / Security Assertion Markup Language
- **What?** XML based protocol for user authentication, not user authorization. It helps in achieving SSO(Single Sign On). 
- [How SAML Works](HOW_SAML_Works)
- SAML uses:
  - *XML Digital Signature* for authentication and Integrity.
  - *XML Encryption:* Uses encrypted name identifiers, encrypted attributes, and encrypted assertions
  - [HTTP](Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer5/Protocols/HTTP) as communication protocol.
  - Uses SOAP 1.1
