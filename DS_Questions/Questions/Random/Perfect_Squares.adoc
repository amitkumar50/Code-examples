Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.
```c
- Example 1:
Input: n = 12
Output: 3 
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.

- Example 2:
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
```

== Approach-1. Dynamic Programming
=== Logic
* Define subproblems: Let's define a subproblem dp[i] as the least number of perfect square numbers that sum up to the given number i.
* Base case:
```
    dp[0] = 0, as it takes zero perfect square numbers to sum up to zero.
    dp[1] = 1, as the only perfect square number less than or equal to 1 is 1 itself.
```
* Recurrence relation:
** For any integer i, we iterate through all possible perfect square numbers less than or equal to i and find the minimum among dp[i - j*j] + 1. 
Here, j*j represents one of the perfect squares
```
Suppose we want to find the least number of perfect square numbers needed to sum up to i = 12. We iterate through all perfect square numbers less than or equal to i. 
These perfect square numbers are 1, 4, 9.

Now, for each of these perfect squares, we calculate dp[i - j*j] + 1, which represents the minimum number of perfect squares needed to sum up to i - j*j, 
plus 1 (since we're considering one more perfect square, j*j).

Let's illustrate:

For j = 1, j*j = 1, so we calculate dp[12 - 1*1] + 1 = dp[11] + 1.
For j = 2, j*j = 4, so we calculate dp[12 - 2*2] + 1 = dp[8] + 1.
For j = 3, j*j = 9, so we calculate dp[12 - 3*3] + 1 = dp[3] + 1.

We then take the minimum among these values to get dp[12], the least number of perfect square numbers needed to sum up to 12.
```

=== Complexity
* Time: O(n * sqrt(n))
* Space: O(n)

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSquares(int n) {
        vector<long> dp(n+1,INT_MAX);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (long i=1;i<=n;i++) {
            for (long j=1; j*j<=i; j++) {
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-j*j] + 1);
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
