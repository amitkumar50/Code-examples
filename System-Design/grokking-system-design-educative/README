Step 1: Requirements clarifications
- Ask questions about the exact scope of the problem we are solving.
- Since we only have 35-40 minutes to design a system, we should clarify what parts of the system are required.

Step 2: Back-of-the-envelope estimation
- What scale is expected from the system (e.g., number of new tweets, number of tweet views, 
number of timeline generations per sec., etc.)?
- How much storage will we need?
- What network bandwidth usage are we expecting?

Step 3: System interface definition
- Define what APIs are expected from the system? Ex for twitter
postTweet(user_id, tweet_data, tweet_location, user_location, timestamp, …)  
generateTimeline(user_id, current_time, user_location, …)  
markTweetFavorite(user_id, tweet_id, timestamp, …)  

Step 4: Defining data model
