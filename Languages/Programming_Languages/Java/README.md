## About
- By Sun micro systems(1995)
- **What?** Java is a language+collection of run-time-libraries.  Compiler javac(written in java). IDE's(Netbeans, Eclipse).
  - _J2EE?_ Platform for Enterprise Applications    J2ME?Platform for Mobile Applications. 
  - _JDK(JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT)_ SDK, for developing application and applets. This includes JRE,  JavaDoc(documentation generator), javac(compiler), jar(archiver) etc. For development and running you need this.
  - _JRE(JAVA RUNTIME ENV)_: Includes JVM+library classes. If you only want to run Java applications you would need JRE.
  - _JVM(JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE)/INTERPRETER_: JVM executes the java program line-by-line. JVM becomes an instance of JRE at runtime of a Java program.
- **CATEGORIES**     a. core-java    b. Advanced-java    c. J2EE(without completing core, advanced java, You will not understand J2EE)
- **RUNTIME PLATFORMS:**    
  a. J2SE(Java 2 Standard Edition): Includes libraries for JDBC(Java DB Connectivity), JNDI(Java Naming Directory Interface), RMI(Remote Method Invocation), AWT , Swing
  b. J2EE(Java 2 Enterprise Edition):  Includes Java Mail,  JAXB (Java API for XML Binding), Servlets, JSF (Java Server Faces), JMS (Java Messaging Service), EJB (Enterprise Java Beans).
  c. J2ME(Java 2 Micro Edition): APIs for handheld devices.

## Features of Java
- **Platform Independent:** 
  - Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run. ie byte-code can be generated on MAC & run on linux/Windows.
- **Secure:** a. Java always runs on JRE which has almost 0 interaction with OS hence secure.  b. No pointers(hence no SEG faults)    c. Runtime exception handling.        //Secure wrt C,C++
- **Robust:** Code is made robust as Java introduces, Memory management & mishandled exceptions.
- **Architecture Neutral:** Compiler generates bytecode which has nothing to do with computer architecture.
- **Portable:** bytecode can be carried to any platform, no implementation depend features.
- Multi-threaded
- **Distributed:** We can create distributed application in Java using RMI, EJB.
- **Automatic Garbage Collection:** Looking at heap memory, finding what objects are in use & what not. Deleting the un-used Objects.
- **Speed:** Memory is allocated on Eden space and its not guaranteed that it will be allocated contiguously. Non-contiguous memory is slower wrt to contiguous.        //Java is slow wrt C,C++

## Memory Layout of Java Program
Since program runs inside JVM, we will also see How JVM looks on memory.
```java
                                 |---   Stack   Area      -----|  |----    PC(program counter Registers ---|
    [ Method Area ] [ Heap area] <--Thread-1----><-Thread-2---->  <Register-Thread-1><Register-Thread-2> [Native-Method-Stack]
                                  Stack-Frames LVA,OS,FD 
```

- _Method Area_ Heap memory created by JVM at startup and all threads share this. JVM stores following information here: FQDN of a type (ex: String), Type's modifiers, Type's direct superclass name, Structured list of the fully qualified names of super interfaces.
- _Heap Area:_ This is created on JVM startup. Only 1 heap exists for each running JVM process. By default, the maximum heap size is set to 64 MB.
  - What is stored on Heap area:    a. Instance of objects allocated using new keyword.     b. Arrays
- Understanding Heap Area
```java
    <---------------------        Young Space            ------------------->    <---------  Old Space   --------->
    | Eden Space | S0(Survivor-0) | S1(Survivor-1) | Keep Area |
    Minor GC                                                                        Major GC 
```                                        
- _Nursery/Young Space/Young Generation_
  - Nursery is divided into - Eden space, 2 survivor spaces.
  - Eden space: Stores newly created objects.
  - Survivor Spaces: When Eden becomes full, Minor garbage collector(Minor GC) is run and objects present from long are moved to Survivor spaces, ensuring 1 survivor space is always empty. Objects that survived many cycles of GC, are moved to old generation memory space.
  - Keep Area: Contains the most recently allocated objects in the nursery and is not garbage collected until the next young generation. 
- Old Space/Old Generation
  - Garbage collection is performed in Old generation memory when itâ€™s full called Major GC and usually takes longer time

- _Stack AreaðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¬ This is created when Thread is created. Stack memory is allocated per thread. It contains references to heap objects. 
  - Stack-Frame: This is a data structure that contains the thread's data. Only one frame (the frame for executing method) is active at any point in a given thread of control. This frame is called the current frame. Contains:
    - Local Variable Array (LVA), Operand Stack (OS), and Frame Data (FD). 
- PC-Registers: Each thread has a Program Counter (PC) register associated with it. PC register stores the return address or a native pointer. It also contains the address of the JVM instructions currently being executed.
- Native Method Stack/C stack: This stack is for native code written in a language other than Java

## Datatypes
### Primitive Datatypes
```java
datatype| size (byte) | Range
  ------|-------------|--------------
  Byte  | 1   signed  | -128 to 127
  short | 2           | -32768 to 32767
  int   | 4           | -2pow31 to 2pow31-1
  long  | 8           | -2pow63 to 2pow63-1
  float | 4           | 
  double| 8           |
  bool  | 1           | 
  char  | 2           |
```

## Input Output
<a name=i1></a>
#### 1. Reading stdin & dump on stdout
[scanner class](#s)
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int i = scan.nextInt();                   //Read int
        double d = scan.nextDouble();             //Read double
        scan.nextLine();                          //Scanner.nextInt() or Scanner.nextDouble() does not read the newline character
                                                  //in input created by hitting "Enter" hence Scanner.nextLine returns after reading that newline
        String s = scan.nextLine();
        System.out.println("String: " + s);
        System.out.println("Double: " + d);
        System.out.println("Int: " + i);
    }
}
```

#### 2. Formatted output
- `%n` is newline
```java
float a = 4.2f;
System.out.printf("%.4f", a);         //4.2000                      //Printing upto 4 precisions

float n = 2324435.3f;
System.out.printf("%20.4f n=",n);     //n =         2324435.2500    //number is formatted from right margin & occupies width of 20 characters

String s="java";
int a = 20;
System.out.printf("%-15s%03d%n", s, a);   //java           20
```

## Classes

### Scanner
Scanner class is used to get user input, and it is found in the java.util package. Available methods in scanner class
```java
nextLine():   Read string from stdin
nextInt():    Read int from stdin
