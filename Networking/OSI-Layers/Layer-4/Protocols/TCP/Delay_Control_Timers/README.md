## Delay Control Timers
- TCP uses several timers to ensure that excessive delays are not encountered during communications.

### Four Timers
- **1. RTO(RE-TRANSMISSION TIMEOUT)** 
  - Default:3 seconds
  - For tracking lost segments. When a segment is sent, a RTO is started. If the segment is acknowledged before the timer expires, the timer is stopped.
  - If, on the other hand, the timer goes off before the acknowledgement comes in, the segment is retransmitted (and the timer is started again).    
    - RTT(ROUND TRIP TIME)/RTD(ROUND TRIP DELAY TIME)/PING TIME? Time taken for a packet reach destination + time for it's acknowledgement to be received. This time delay includes the propagation times for the paths between the two endpoints.
    - RTO CALCULATIONS?  RTO = RTTs + 4*RTTd
      - Measured RTT(RTTm): Time required for the segment to reach the destination and be acknowledged.
      - Smoothed RTT(RTTs): It is the weighted average of RTTm. RTTm is likely to change and its fluctuation is so high that a single measurement cannot be used to calculate RTO.   RTTs= (1-t)*RTTs + t*RTTm
      - Deviated RTT(RTTd):   RTTd= (1-k)*RTTd + k*(RTTm-RTTs)
      - Note: At every re-transmission RTO gets doubled.
- **2. PERSISTENT TIMER(PREVENTING DEADLOCK)**
  - DEADLOCK?
    - Sender sends a segment, receiver receives packet and sends an acknowledgement with a window size of 0, telling the sender to wait.
    - Later, the receiver updates the window, but the packet with the update is lost. Now the sender and the receiver are each waiting for the other to do something. 
  - HOW TIMER WORKS?
    - On reception of ack with window-size=0, sender starts a persistent timer.
    - After timer is expired sender sends a probe of size = 1 byte. The probe causes the receiving TCP to resend the acknowledgment which was lost. 
    - Probe has a sequence number, but its sequence number is never acknowledged or can be ignored.
- **3. KEEP ALIVE TIMER**
  - (default = 2 hours) 
  - WHAT?
    - When a connection has been idle for a long time, the keepalive timer may go off to cause one side to check whether the other side is still there. 
    - This may the case, client connects server, does some exchange and then client crashes. Now connection remains open forever
  - HOW IT WORKS? 
    - Each time the server hears from a client, it resets this timer. If the server does not hear from the client after 2 hours, it sends a probe segment. 
    - If there is no response after 10 probes, each of which is 75 s apart, it assumes that the client is down and terminates the connection.
- **4. TIME WAIT TIMER**    //Read Time_Wait state 1st
    - HOW IT WORKS?
      - Sender starts the time wait timer after sending the ACK for the second FIN segment. It allows to resend the final acknowledgement if it gets lost.
      - The value of time wait timer is usually set to twice the lifetime of a TCP segment.
