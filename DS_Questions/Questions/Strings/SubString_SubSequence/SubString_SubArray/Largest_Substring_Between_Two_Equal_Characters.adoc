== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-substring-between-two-equal-characters/[1624. Largest Substring Between Two Equal Characters]
Given a string s, return the length of the longest substring between two equal characters, excluding the two characters. If there is no such substring return -1.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

``` 
Example 1:
Input: s = "aa"
Output: 0
Explanation: The optimal substring here is an empty substring between the two 'a's.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abca"
Output: 2
Explanation: The optimal substring here is "bc".

Example 3:
Input: s = "cbzxy"
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no characters that appear twice in s.
```

== Approach-1. O(n). store indexes in Hashmap
=== Logic
* Store index of characters in unordered_map<char,int>
* At every new character, search it inside map, it found store (index-map_value)

=== Complexity
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n)

=== Code
==== CPP98
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxLengthBetweenEqualCharacters(string s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> umPosition;
        int maxi = 0;
        for (int i=0;i<s.size();i++) {
            auto it = umPosition.find(s[i]);
            if (it != umPosition.end()) {
                maxi = max(maxi, i-it->second);
            } else {
                umPosition.insert({s[i], i});
            }
        }
        return maxi-1;
    }
};
```

==== CPP11
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxLengthBetweenEqualCharacters(string s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> umPosition;
        int maxi = 0, index=0;
        for_each(s.begin(), s.end(), [&umPosition, &maxi, &index](char ch){
            auto it = umPosition.find(ch);
            if (it != umPosition.end())
                maxi = max(maxi, index-it->second);
            else
                umPosition.insert({ch, index});
            index++;
        });
  }
