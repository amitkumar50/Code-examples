== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-node-and-ancestor/[1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor]
Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value v for which there exist different nodes a and b where v = |a.val - b.val| and a is an ancestor of b.

A node a is an ancestor of b if either: any child of a is equal to b or any child of a is an ancestor of b. 

Example 1:

```c
Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3
Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.
```

== Approach-1. DFS
=== Logic
* Initialize the minimum and maximum values to the root node's value.
* Traverse the tree using a recursive approach.
* Update the minimum and maximum values encountered during the traversal.
* At each node, calculate the difference between the current node's value and the updated minimum and maximum values.
* Update the global maximum difference if a larger difference is found.
* Recursively explore the left and right subtrees.
* Return the maximum difference after the traversal.

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

        int min_ansector = root->val, max_ansector = root->val;
        dfs (root, min_ansector, max_ansector);
        return max_diff;
    }
    void dfs (TreeNode* root, int min_ansector, int max_ansector) {
        if (!root)
            return;
        
        // if present node value is smaller than min_ansector
        max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(min_ansector - root->val));

        // if present node value is greater than max_ansector
        // update max_diff
        max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(max_ansector - root->val));

        min_ansector = min(min_ansector, root->val);
        max_ansector = max(max_ansector, root->val);
        dfs(root->left, min_ansector, max_ansector);
        dfs(root->right, min_ansector, max_ansector);
    }
