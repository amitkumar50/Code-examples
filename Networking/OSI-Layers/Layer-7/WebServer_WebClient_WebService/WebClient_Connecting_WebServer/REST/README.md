## REST / (Representation State Transfer) APIs
**Restful Web Server/Application?** Web application that implements [HTTP CRUD methods](/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer-7/Protocols/HTTP/README.md#mea) in Restful way. Eg: Twitter, facebook are implemented using restful APIs.
- When web-client calls Restful APIs then Web-Server can return [JSON](/Languages/ScriptingLanguages/JavaScript) or HTML or [XML](/Languages/Markup_Language).

### How REST Works?
```c
1. Web server(abc.com) defines Resources(Eg: Customers, movies, cars etc) and exposes a service/End point (https://abc.com/api/movies)
   abc.com  : Domain
   api      : Convention(mostly used by companies) to expose RESTful services
   movies   : Resource 
2. Web client will use above END POINT to talk to Web server/service.
3. 

   Client	                        	                Web Service
 http://<ip-address>/api/resource-name
                                          Implement APIs GET(){..} POST(){..} DELETE(){..} PUT(){..}
                     <---data----
```
**Why Restful**
- *1. Rest makes Web Service OS Independent:* Web applications can reside on different operating systems, some could be on Windows, and others could be on Linux.
- *2. Rest makes Web Service language independent:* Web services can be implemented in any language(C++,RUST etc)
- *3. On Cloud:* RESTful applications are moved can reside on cloud. Azure and Amazon provide a lot of API's based on the Restful architecture.

### Restful Methods/APIs/Verbs
Web Client call these [HTTP CRUD methods](/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer-7/Protocols/HTTP/README.md#mea) and response returned over HTTP.
```c
  - POST: This will create a new record in web service
  - GET: Get list of all records in web service
  - PUT: Update a record in web service
  - DELETE: delete 1 record in web service
```

## Comparisons
**REST vs [HTTP](/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer-7/Protocols/HTTP/)**

||REST|HTTP|
|---|---|---|
|What|Set of rules|L7 protocol|
|Focus|Resource|Methods to get|

**REST vs SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol)**

||REST|SOAP|
|---|---|---|
|Why|To access web service|Same|
|Flexible|More|Less, hard to use|
|Relies on|JSON,XML,CSV,RSS|XML, CORBA(Common Object Request Broker Architecture) rely on binary messaging|
|Advgs over soap|small learning curve, smaller messages||

### Constraints for RESTFUL application
- **a. Uniform interface:**
  - client request must include a resource identifier. The response the server returns include enough information so the client can modify the resource.
- **b. Client - server separation:** 
  - The client and the server act independently, each on its own, and the interaction between them is only in the form of requests, initiated by the client only.
- **c. Stateless:** Server does not store information about client who uses the APIs.
- **d. Layered system:** 
  - Between the client who requests a representation of a resourceâ€™s state, and the server who sends the response back, there might be a number of servers in the middle.These servers might provide a security, caching, load-balancing layers or                 other functionality. 
- **e. Cacheable:** 
  - Data sent by server contains information about whether or not the data is cacheable. If the data is cacheable, it might contain sort of a version number. Since the client knows which version of the data it has the client can avoid requesting the                         same data again.
- **f. Code-on-demand(optional):** 
  - The client can request code from the server, and then the response from the server will contain some code, usually in the form of a script. The client then can execute that code.
