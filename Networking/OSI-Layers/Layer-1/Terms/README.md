## Terms
- **Bandwidth?**
  - The width of the frequency range transmitted without getting attenuated is called the bandwidth.
  - BW depends on, construction, thickness, and length of a wire or fiber. 802.11 wireless channels are allowed to use up to roughly 20 MHz
- **Baseband signal?** Signals that run from 0 up to a maximum frequency are called baseband signals.
- **Passband signal?** Signals that are shifted to occupy a higher range of frequencies are called passband signals.
- **Frequency?** The number of oscillations per second of a wave. Measured in Hz (in honor of Heinrich Hertz)
- **Wavelength?** The distance between two consecutive maxima (or minima) is called the wavelength, which is designated by the Greek letter Î» (lambda)
- **SNR/Signal-to-Noise Ratio?** The amount of thermal noise present. If we denote the signal power by S and the noise power by N, the signal-to-noise ratio is S/N The units of this log scale are called decibels (dB).
