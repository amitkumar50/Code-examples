### STABLE/UNSTABLE 
- Stability of algorithm is judged mainly on this form of input `<key, value>` (Eg: people names as keys and their details as values), and we wish to sort these objects by keys. - - Algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted
 - **STABLE:** Bubble, insertion, merge, count    
- **UNSTABLE:** quick, heap
