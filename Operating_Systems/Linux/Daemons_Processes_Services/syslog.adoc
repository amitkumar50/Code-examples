== syslog (System Logging Protocol)
* Protocol for sending and receiving log and event messages in a network. 
* Syslog messages are generated by various network devices, such as routers, switches, firewalls, and servers, to record events and activities.
* These messages are valuable for monitoring and troubleshooting network issues, as they provide information about system events, errors, warnings, and other important activities.
