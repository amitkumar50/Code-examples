## GPU(Graphics Processing Unit)
- **What**
  - This is specialized electronic circuit created for manipulating images rapidly. ie Specialized in Graphics & Image processing.
  - GPUs are used in mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles.
  - They work on ***parallel computing***.
  - **Companies** In 2018 AMD/ATI(33%) & Nvidia(66%) captured 100% of GPU market.	
- **GPU Usages?**
  - Create high resolution images, videos
  - In machine training, deep learning neural networks, GPUs can be 250 times faster than CPUs.
  - Complex mathematical calculations.
  - financial simulations and risk modeling
- **CPU vs GPU**
