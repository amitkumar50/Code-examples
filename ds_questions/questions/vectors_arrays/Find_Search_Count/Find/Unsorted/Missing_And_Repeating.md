### Problem
- Continious, unsorted Array from `[1, n]`. Array will always start from 1. 
- Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing.
- Return A and B in linear runtime complexity & without using extra memory.
- A=Repeated, B=Missing
- Examples
```c++
Ex-1:
    {3,4,1,3,5}   //A=3, B=2. (Series from 1 to 5)
    
Ex-2:    
    {8,9,7,3,6,1,4,5,6}   //A=6, B=2  (series from 1 to 8)  
```
