## Pre-requisites
- *1.* Understand the use case why I need to design a network protocol, which features are missing in existing protocol?
- *2.* Decide the layer for which protocol needs to be written and [Layer's Design Issues & Duties](../../).
- *3.* If its similiar to any(Eg: HTTP)
  - Read its RFC.
  - Intercept network traffic using wireshark and investigate.
- *4.* Read TCP/IP, IP Protocol RFC. Since we need to communicate with layers.
- *5.* Depending on How protocol interacts with OS, we may need to look into assembly as well.
  - For LINUX. Understand Unix OS.
  - For WINDOWS. Understand Winsock(it is a technical specification that defines how Windows network software should access network services, especially TCP/IP)
