== 1716. Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank
* Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day.

* He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday.
Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.

```c
Example 1:
Input: n = 4
Output: 10
Explanation: After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

Example 2:
Input: n = 10
Output: 37
Explanation: After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.

Example 3:
Input: n = 20
Output: 96
Explanation: After the 20th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) + (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) = 96.
```

```c
After every 7 steps, we start from (start+1), where start=1
            1 2 3 4 5 6 7
            |
            start

            2 3 4 5 6 7 8
            |
            start+1
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int totalMoney(int n) {
        int start = 1, j = start, i = 0, out = 0;
        while (i < n) {
            out += j;
            j += 1;
            i++;
            if (i%7 == 0) {
                start += 1;
                j = start;
            }
        }
        return out;
    }
};
