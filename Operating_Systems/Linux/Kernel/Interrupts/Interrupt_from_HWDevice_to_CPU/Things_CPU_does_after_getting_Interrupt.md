## Things CPU does after getting interrupt
- CPU is executing a function1() and interrupt occured.
  - *a.* CPU saves following on current function1()'s [STACK](https://sites.google.com/site/amitinterviewpreparation/c-1):
    - Input_parameters, Return_address, Local_variables of function1()
    - Registers [CS, IP(Program Counter)](/Motherboard/CPU/Memory/CPU_Registers)
      - Saved IP points to the first instruction which will be loaded into the processor after the interrupt handler completes.
    - Intermidiate results of calculations which are present [Registers(Accumulator), PSW](/Motherboard/CPU/Memory/CPU_Registers) to Stack.
  - *b.* Create [STACK](https://sites.google.com/site/amitinterviewpreparation/c-1) for interrupt routine.
    - Copies arguments, local variables to ISR stack.
  - *c.* IP now points to address of interrupt routine.
  - *d.* Swaps new page in RAM ie changes [MMU, Page Table, TLB](https://sites.google.com/site/amitinterviewpreparation/c-1/memory-management/virtual-memory)
  - *e.* ACK interrupt controller
  - *f.* Jumps to [ISR(Interrupt service routine)](ISR) after looking from [IVT(Interrupt Vector Table)](IVT).
