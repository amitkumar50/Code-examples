== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-prefix-of-word[2000. Reverse Prefix of Word]
Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.

For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
Return the resulting string.
```c
Example 1:
Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".

Example 2:
Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"
Output: "zxyxxe"
Explanation: The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".
```

== Approach-1. Find index, reverse
=== Logic
* Find character inside word.
* Reverse till the index
* return original string

=== Complexity
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(1)

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reversePrefix(string word, char ch) {
        auto it = find(word.begin(), word.end(), ch);
        if (it != word.end())
            reverse(word.begin(), it+1);
        return word;
    }
};
```

==== Rust
```rs
impl Solution {
    fn reverse_string_till_index(text: &str, index: usize) -> String {      
        let mut chars: Vec<char> = text.chars().take(index + 1).collect();
        chars.reverse();
        chars.into_iter().collect()
    }    

    pub fn reverse_prefix(word: String, ch: char) -> String {
        let index = match word.find(ch) {
            Some (a)=>a,
            None => {
                return word;
            }
        };
        Solution::reverse_string_till_index(&word, index) + (&word[index+1..])
    }
}
```
