### 6R's / 6 Migration Strategies
When migrating applications to the cloud, six of the most common migration strategies that you can implement are:

|Strategy|What|
|---|---|
|1. Rehosting(lift-and-shift)| Moving existing applications without changes|
|2. Replatforming(lift, tinker, and shift)| Making a few cloud optimizations(without changing the core architecture of application) & shift|
|3. Refactoring/re-architecting|Add new features (scale, performance) then migrate|
|4. Repurchasing|Abandon legacy software and buy new softwares from new vendors/cloud native software from AWS|
|5. Retaining|keeping applications that are critical for the business in the source code. Major refactoring might be needed before retiring them|
|6. Retiring|removing applications that are no longer needed|
