## Terms
- **Bandwidth?** The width of the frequency range transmitted without being strongly attenuated is called the bandwidth. e bandwidth is a physical property of the transmission medium that depends on, for example, the construction, thickness, and length of a wire or fiber. 802.11 wireless channels are allowed to use up to roughly 20 MHz
- **Baseband, Passband?** Signals that run from 0 up to a maximum frequency are called baseband signals. Signals that are shifted to occupy a higher range of frequencies, as is the case for all wireless transmissions, are called passband signals.
-  **SNR?** The amount of thermal noise present is measured by the ratio of the signal power to the noise power, called the SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio). If we denote the signal power by S and the noise power by N, the signal-to-noise ratio is S/N The units of this log scale are called decibels (dB)
- **Guided, Unguided media?** Media are roughly grouped into guided media, such as copper wire
and fiber optics, and unguided media, such as terrestrial wireless, satellite, and
lasers through the air
