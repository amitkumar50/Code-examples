## Decltype
- **What?** Inspects the type of an entity/expression.
- **Why use decltype?** When declaring types that are difficult or impossible to declare using standard notation, like lambda-related types or types that depend on template parameters.        
- **SYNTAX?**
```c++
  decltype ( expression )         //Since C++11
  decltype ( type )               //Since C++11
```
