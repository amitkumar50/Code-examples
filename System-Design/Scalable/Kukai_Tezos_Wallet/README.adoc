=== Kukai?
* DApp(link:/System-Design/Concepts/Decentralization.adoc[Decentrailized App]) lightweight wallet service(Similar to link:/BlockChain#electrum[Electrum]) on Tezos blockchain that helps:
** Creating user-friendly wallet interface(Users to manage their Tezos assets)
** Interact with smart contracts, and engage with the Tezos ecosystem
* kukai does not hold complete blockchain like bitcoin core client.                                                                                                          

=== Requirements
==== Functional
* 1. Users can create, import, and manage Tezos wallets. 
* 2. Store private keys for users.
* 3. Users can securely send, receive, and store XTZ and other tokens.
* _4. Smart Contract Interaction:_ Users can interact with smart contracts on the Tezos network through Kukai's interface
* _5. Transaction Fees and Gas:_ Provide information about transaction fees ("gas fees" in etherum) and helps users estimate the appropriate fee for their transactions.

==== Non-Functional
* _1. Response Time:_ Acceptable response times for various user interactions, such as loading balances, sending transactions, or interacting with smart contracts
** Loading Balance: less than 1 sec
** Sending Transactions: 2-3 sec
** Interacting with Smart Contracts: 3-5 sec. Since it might more complex operations.
* _2. Scalable:_ Plan for the application's ability to handle increased user activity and transaction volume without a significant drop in performance.
* _3. Data Encryption:_ Sensitive user data, private keys, and other confidential information must be stored and transmitted using encryption protocols.
* _4. Reliable:_ 
** How application should handle errors, such as failed transactions, connection issues, or unexpected behavior
** Ensure that data stored on the blockchain or in associated databases remains accurate and consistent

=== BOE
==== Transactions per Second (TPS)
* Required Response time:(2-3 seconds) and let's suppose total 10,000 users are using tezos blockchain having kukai (wallet) installed locally on their systems.
```c
TPS = Concurrent Users / Response Time per Transaction
TPS = 10,000 users / 3 seconds (assuming the higher end of the 2-3 second range)
TPS â‰ˆ 3333 TPS
```

=== API Design
|===
| Requirement | API 

| 1. Create new Tezos wallet for a user | link:/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer-7/Protocols/HTTP/Methods[POST] /api/wallets
| 2. Import an existing Tezos wallet | POST /api/wallets/import
| 3. Retrieve wallet details by wallet ID | link:/Networking/OSI-Layers/Layer-7/Protocols/HTTP/Methods[GET] /api/wallets/:walletId
| 4. Get the Tezos balance of a wallet | GET /api/wallets/:walletId/balance
| 5. Initiate a transaction to send XTZ or tokens to another address | POST /api/transactions/send
| 6. Smart contract detials(Retrieve contract details and information) | GET /api/contracts/:contractAddress
| 7. Transaction Fees and Gas | GET /api/fees/estimate

=== HLD
```c
                                        | User Local DB(stores user IDs, wallet addresses) |
                                                          |
                                                        cache
                                                          |

  tezos blockchain      <--RPC calls--> [Tezos Node] <> Backend  <---APIs---->   Frontend  <--> User
====================    <---smart contract--|
 other tezos nodes
====================
```
* *Frontend:* In React, Angular, or Vue.js
* *Backend:* Use Node.js, Python, or Ruby
==== Tezos Node (hosted on machine or cloud)
* This is client application of Tezos blockchain and should run on client. This is seperate from tezos blockchain.
* Like link:/BlockChain#1-bitcoin-core-fullnode-bitcoin-client[bitcoin core client], this will have complete copy of blockchain
* *Function:* 1. Communicate with other nodes to reach consensus on the state of the blockchain

====== Components of Tezos node
* _1.  P2P Network Layer:_ communicates with other Tezos nodes in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.
* _2. Consensus Layer:_ Handles unique consensus mechanism called "Liquid Proof of Stake" (LPoS).
* _3. Chain Data Management:_ stores and manages the blockchain data
* _4. Mempool:_ Holds pending transactions that have been broadcast to the network but haven't yet been included in a block
* _5. Validation and Verification:_
