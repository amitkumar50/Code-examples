== link:https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range/[201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range]
Given two integers left and right that represent the range [left, right], return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.
```c
Example 1:
Input: left = 5, right = 7
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: left = 0, right = 0
Output: 0
```

== Approach-1. TLE
=== Logic
* Find bitwise AND of all numbers between left and right
* TLE for left=1, right=2147483647

=== Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
      int out = left;
      for (int i=left+1; i<right; ++i) {
        out = out & i;
      }
      return out;
    }
};
```

== Approach-2
=== Logic
* We need to find the common prefix of the binary representation of left and right.
```c
left = 5     101
right= 7     111    //common prefix=1
```
* Perform right shift until left < right 
```c
            left     right
            101      111
right shift 10       11
            1        1    //steps=2
```
* Now left shift left by steps calculated above.

=== Code
==== CPP
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
          //s = shift;
       int s=0;
       while(left<right){
           left>>=1;  //l left
           right>>=1;  //r right
           s++;
       }
       return left<<s;
    }
};
```
