### Blockchain
A sequence of blocks validated by the proof-of-work system, each linking to its predecessor all the way to the genesis block.
### Consensus algorithm
Ethereum uses Bitcoinâ€™s consensus model, Nakamoto Consensus, which uses sequential single-signature blocks, weighted in importance by PoW to determine the longest chain and therefore the current state. However, there are plans to move to a PoS weighted voting system, codenamed Casper, in the near future.

### Ether
Ether is intended as a utility currency to pay for use of the Ethereum platform

<a name=eth></a>
### Ethereum
Framework/platform for creating smart contracts. Etherum runs solidity programming language.

<a name=sc></a>
### Smart Contract
Represents aggrement b/w 2 parties & allows parties to securly conduct business. Properties:
- _1. Immutable(cannot be changed):_ SC creates logs which are immutable, those cannot be changed.
- _2. Distributed:_ Output of contract is Validated/verified by other nodes on the network.

<a name=so></a>
### Solidity
- High level Object oriented programming language for writing smart contracts.
- Features;
  - _1._ Based on C,C++,python
  - _2._ Statically typed: Checking happens at compile time.
  - _3. Supports inheritance:_ 1 smart contract can be used by other.

### Transactions
Ethereum transactions are network messages that include (among other things) a sender, recipient, value, and data payload.
